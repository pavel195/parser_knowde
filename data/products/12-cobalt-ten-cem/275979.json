    "description": "Cobalt-Free Drier / Sustainable Solution for Improved Dry Time in Alkyd PaintBorchi® OXY-Coat is a metal-based high-performance cobalt-free drier catalyst for improved drying time in paints containing alkyd resins. It demonstrates excellent drying performance at low use levels in solvent-based short, medium, and long oil alkyd paint. This solution does not require the use of an auxiliary drier. Cobalt-free driers are eco-friendly drying solutions as they do not contain any metals that may face regulatory concerns . Borchi® OXY-Coat is particularly efficient in coatings using propylene glycol.  Comparison of Borchi® OXY-Coat in Medium Oil Alkyd Paint  Borchi® OXY-Coat provides improved drying time compared to a cobalt drier in medium oil alkyd paint. This oxidative curing catalyst also works well in short and long oil alkyd systems .",
