    "description": "31047 DAC® Beverage System Cleaner is a twin-alkaline formula that penetrates embedded residue on heavily soiled, case hardened, and problematic beer lines. High quality surfactants suspend soils and improve rinsability. Ultra concentrated formula means less product per gallon of water to achieve the same cleaning power of competing products. For a color rinse indicator, use with our All-Klear tablets.",
