    "description": "3D SP E™ -5 is a breathable semi-penetrating/ semi-topical sealer that helps to protect surfaces against stains and etching. It creates a water-resistant barrier that prevents liquids from infiltrating the surface, protecting against staining and color dispersion. Since reformulating the original 3D SP formula, 3D SP E has better abrasion and chemical resistance, but maintains the same easy application methods you’ve become accustomed to using.",
