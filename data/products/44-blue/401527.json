    "description": "72 Red™ is a very high viscosity, thixotropic, high strength threadlocker. It has excellent high temperature resistance (up to 400F) and can be used on large fasteners, where a high break away torque is desired. Because it is high in viscosity, It will not run out of the joint before it cures and can be used in applications requiring good gap filling abilities.",
