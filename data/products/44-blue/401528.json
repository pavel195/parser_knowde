    "description": "77 RED™ is a very high viscosity high strength threadlocker. It should be used on large fasteners, where a high break away torque is desired. Because it is high in viscosity, 77 RED™ will not run out of the joint before it cures and can be used in applications requiring good gap filling abilities.",
