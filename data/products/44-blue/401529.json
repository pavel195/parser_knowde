    "description": "90 GREEN™ is a medium strength , very low viscosity, wicking grade threadlocker and porosity filler. Use 90 GREEN™ on applications requiring a fast setting anaerobic product to seal and lock small screws and threaded fasteners. 90 GREEN™ is ideal in applications where additional torque can not be applied to a delicate fastener, but greater off torque is desired. Because of it’s ability to wick by capillary action, 90 GREEN™ can be applied to small fasteners that have already been assembled. It is also the perfect product for sealing porosities in welds and cast parts.",
