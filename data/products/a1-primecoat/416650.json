    "description": "CPP™ Sprayliner™ is two-component moisture insensitive, highly adhesive, chemical resistant, 100% solids, high strength and reinforced epoxy. Equal to “standard” CPP once cured, this version is packaged more conveniently for spray applicators seeking to utilize plural-component heated spray application. The material can be sprayed ultra-high build, between 1/16” - 1/4” (62.5 - 250 miles) per pass. Blended with reinforcing agents and various fibers, the Epoxytec CPP™ Sprayliner™ when cured creates reinforcement lining as a fiber-reinforced-polymer (FRP), with high strength and flexural properties for partially or fully deteriorated structures.",
