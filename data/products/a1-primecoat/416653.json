    "description": "Uroseal™ 45V polyurethane joint sealant is a two-components, aliphatic, chemically curing, 100% solid urethane sealant formulated as a high build coating / joint sealing system for vertical and overhead use. Once cured, the material forms a high-quality elastomeric sealant. Uroseal™ 45V is ideally suited for indoors or outdoors with use on concrete, wood, and most construction materials. Uroseal™ 45V produces a flexible, long‐lasting sealant with extraordinary adhesion, cohesion, and elasticity that resists deterioration caused by weathering, stress, movement, water, oils, and many chemicals. Provides corrosion protection and chemical resistance; and because of its mixed gel‐state, it is specially designed for use on vertical and overhead applications.",
