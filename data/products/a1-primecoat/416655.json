    "description": "B1 Primecoat™ is designed as a high-performance sealer and coating formulated for concrete. B1 Primecoat™ is supplied in a convenient one-to-one mix ratio. B1 Primecoat™ is capable of penetrating and filling the porous structure of concrete in order to provide an effective subsurface barrier to prevent moisture migration, out-gassing, and chemical penetration. Epoxytec B1 Primecoat™ exhibits highly penetrating properties which provide porous filling and strengthening of the top concrete layer to form a sufficiently strong base for subsequent top coats.",
