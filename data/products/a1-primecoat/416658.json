    "description": "Mortartec Silicate™ is an industrial-grade blend of Portland cement, graded silica sand, fibers and silica fume. The mortar may be hand or spray applied, typically from ½” to 2” in depth. Uses include repairing concrete walls, ceilings, lining brick or concrete infrastructure, etc. Mortartec Silicate provides an extremely dense matrix and will accept coatings at earlier ages than typical Portland cement repair products.",
