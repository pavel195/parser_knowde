    "description": "Acrylic 57-1™ is recommended for floors, cabinets and trim, and metal and plastic elements. As it has a very low odor and low VOC’s, it is an excellent choice for coating floors and other surfaces in enclosed areas such as basements, hospitals, schools and restaurants, This product has a non-yellowing high-gloss finish with exceptional mar resistance. Although it works well on its own, it also makes an excellent choice as a topcoat for other coatings.",
