    "description": "Abotar 8101-8™ is a versatile tar-epoxy that provides controllable flexibility when filling, resurfacing, and patching asphalt. Abotar 8101-8 is an excellent choice for use on ship decks, runways, parking garages, commercial and industrial floors, pipes, driveways, sidewalks, and roofs. It is weather and waterproof, and resists acids, alkalis, and fuels. Sand or other aggregate can be added to expand volume and enhance the coefficient of thermal expansion (important when patching large areas).",
