    "description": "Solaxis Nylon 12 CF (carbon filled) is a carbon-filled thermoplastic with excellent structural characteristics. The material is comprised of a blend of Nylon 12 resin and chopped carbon fiber, at a loading of 35% by weight. This combination produces one of the strongest thermoplastics in the FDM® material portfolio. It has the highest flexural strength of any FDM thermoplastic, resulting in the highest stiffness-to-weight ratio. Appropriate uses include strong but lightweight tooling applications and functional prototypes in the aerospace, automotive, industrial and recreational manufacturing industries. FDM Nylon 12CF is available on the Fortus 450mc™ and Stratasys F900™ 3D Printers and is compatible with SR-110™ support material.",
