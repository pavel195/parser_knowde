    "description": "Solaxis PC-ABS is one of the most widely used industrial thermoplastics. PC-ABS offers the most desirable properties of both materials – the superior strength and heat resistance of PC and the flexibility of ABS. PC-ABS blends are commonly used in automotive, electronics and telecommunications applications. Additionally, a PC-ABS part manufactured on a Fortus® or Stratasys F370™ 3D Printer is 5-60 percent stronger than a part made on previous FDM® systems. PC-ABS gives you conceptual modeling, functional prototyping, manufacturing tools and production parts.",
