    "description": "Antero™ 800NA is a PEKK-based FDM® thermoplastic. It combines FDM’s design freedom and ease of use with the excellent strength, toughness and wear-resistant properties of PEKK material. Antero 800NA exhibits high heat resistance, chemical resistance, low outgassing and dimensional stability, particularly in large parts. Appropriate applications include aircraft components exposed to jet fuel, oil and hydraulic fluid, spacecraft parts that demand low outgassing and chemical-resistant industrial parts. Using Antero 800NA with FDM technology avoids the waste associated with subtractive manufacturing of high-cost bulk PEKK material. Antero 800NA is available on Fortus 450mc™ and F900™ 3D Printers and is compatible with breakaway support material SUP8000B™.",
