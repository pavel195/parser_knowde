    "description": "Accepta® Bromgard 110 is a liquid corrosion inhibitor and scale dispersant for naturally soft and artificially softened waters. It is a molybdate-based alkaline product, containing threshold agents, dispersants and organic inhibitors offering excellent protection to multi-metal systems. BROMGARD products include a bromine precursor, enabling in-situ generation of bromine in treated systems when dosed in conjunction with ACTIVATOR 120/150. Bromine is a highly effective oxidizing biocide, offering greater efficacy than chlorine when it is used in moderately alkaline evaporative cooling systems.",
