    "description": "Accepta® BS100 is a solution of a powerful non-ionic surface-active agent and antifoam. The product improves the performance of systems, where fouling by slimes is reducing efficiency, by removing and dispersing the deposits. It is particularly effective in conjunction with chlorine/bromine based biocides and is ideally suited to be dosed in conjunction with hypochlorite for cooling tower disinfections. Accepta® BS100 is effective in both recirculating and once-through cooling systems.",
