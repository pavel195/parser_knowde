    "description": "Accepta速 BT-4 is a mildly alkaline blended liquid treatment based on organic tannins. It should be used in conjunction with other supplemental treatments to give a balanced treatment program. Accepta速 BT-4 does not add substantially to the boiler water TDS or alkalinity. Accepta速 BT-4 controls corrosion by the dual mechanism of oxygen scavenging and the formation of a corrosion-resistant iron-tannate film.Please speak to us about designing a complete boiler water treatment plan.",
