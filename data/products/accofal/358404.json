    "description": "Accoat A/S Accowear is a reinforcement consisting of a porous, wearresistant layer of stainless steel. The Fluoroplastic topcoat fills out and covers the porous metal-layer. The metal gives the wearresistance while the Fluoroplastic top layer provides the non-stick and low friction properties of the specific coating. For example ACCOWEAR+ACCOLAN W98 will have the same properties as ACCOLAN W 98 (see separate data sheet) but at the same time an excellent wear-resistance.",
