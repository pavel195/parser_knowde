    "description": "Accoquat速 CS-4000 is a unique blend of cationic emulsifiers in a blended solvent system especially designed for micro-emulsification of formulations of mineral seal oils (MSO) or other organic hydrophobes. It micro-emulsifies MSO effectively with ethylene glycol mono butyl ether as its coupling agent. Accoquat速 CS-4000 can produce micro-emulsions with MSO from 10-30% MSO concentration, (depending on the properties of the MSO), however is most cost effective from 15-30% MSO concentrations. Accoquat速 CS-4000 generally does not require additional emulsifiers or other nonionic surfactants to produce an easily dispersible and fine micro-emulsion for rapid beading and spreading. With substantially less emulsifier it is very cost effective for ultra-type drying aids. Upon dilution in water, its unique blend of chemistries provides a consistently-functioning, high-performance, very fine micro-emulsion with MSOs. It is manufactured in USA.",
