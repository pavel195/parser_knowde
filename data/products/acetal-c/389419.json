    "description": "Smiths Metal Centers Acrylic PMMA is an amorphous thermoplastic which is optically transparent, unaffected by moisture, and offers a high strength-to weight ratio. Common trade names for this material include Plexiglas®, Acrylite® and Lucite®. Acrylics are not recommended for use with chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons, esters or ketones. However, the material is unaffected by aqueous solutions of most detergents, acids, alkali’s and laboratory chemicals. It is both a thermoplastics and transparent plastic and is often used as an alternative to glass, but should not be used in structural applications due to poor impact resistance.",
