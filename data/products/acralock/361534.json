    "description": "ACRALOCK® SA10-100A is high viscosity based methacrylate adhesives. Formulated to use with several activators and mixed at a ratio of 10:1, for bulk dispensing. SA10-100A is used for a longer working time. By choosing from four different strength activators, the user can more readily dial into a specific working time range for specific assembly application requirements. These products are designed with high gap filling capabilities and high strength when adhered to assemblies of thermoset composites and plastics and are formulated to be primerless on most metal surfaces.",
