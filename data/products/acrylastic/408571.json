    "description": "Acrylastic™ UltraRoof™ 510 was designed as a single-part water-based coating with the highest performance in coastal temperate, humid, hot, and extreme alkaline environments. Acrylastic 510 creates a tough, long lasting protective membrane that remains flexible over time even under adverse conditions. Its elongation and tensile strength provide unsurpassed resistance to maintenance traffic, weather conditions, and wear. Its proprietary formula features copolymer elastomeric resins to produce a seamless, flexible, durable membrane that displays exceptional weatherability and UV resistance. Because it is a high-solids coating, Acrylastic 510 has low shrinkage, allowing it to bridge hairline cracks and provide protection against new cracks forming.",
