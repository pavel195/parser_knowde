    "description": "IsoClear is a tough, flexible, transparent coating that protects the AcryLinkG™ roof coating. It forms a protective barrier that resists U.V. penetration and protects the colors from fading. It extends the lifespan of the substrate by protecting it from oxidation, corrosion and infiltration by free radicals. IsoClear is a two component coating. Its exceptional toughness and flexibility is the result of the reaction between a fluoropolymer resin and a polyurethane hardener prior to application.",
