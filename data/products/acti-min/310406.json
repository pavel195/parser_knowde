    "description": "MIN-U-GEL 400 is a hydrous magnesium aluminum silicate with gelling and rheological properties used to thicken and stabilize aqueous systems. MIN-U-GEL® 400 can be used alone or in conjunction with associative thickeners where a low shear thixotrope is needed to support the high shear thixotropy of the associative thickener.\n\n\nMIN-U-GEL® 400 was developed especially with controlled properties specifically to function as a binder during the production of molecular sieves.",
