    "description": "Solar Plus is a highly efficient adjuvant combined with water conditioners and anti-foam. It provides uniform spray coverage over the target surface and reduces the speed of evaporation of the spray solution. This controlled droplet drying action ensures sufficient time for active ingredients to be absorbed by the plant before the spray residue dries on the leaf surface. Solar Plus also reduces alkaline hydrolysis of plant protection products affected by hard water cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+).",
