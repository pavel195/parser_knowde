    "description": "Magistrate R100®, Magnesium is key nutrient used in photosynthesis, ensures optimal enzyme activity for protein synthesis and has roles in aiding phosphate and nitrogen metabolism together with energy transfer. Molybdenum is important for grain set and embryo maintenance. It is involved in enzyme functions associated with nitrate reduction and sulfur metabolism. Molybdenum deficiency in brassica crops, especially cauliflower, can lead to a narrowing of leaves known as “whiptail”. R100 biostimulant boosts the uptake and utilization of cationic nutrients (e.g. Mg) and increases cytokinin levels to stimulate growth.",
