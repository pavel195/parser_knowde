    "description": "Zeus Industrial Products Reinforced Polyimide Tubing is a class of high performing polymers well established in industry for their outstanding chemical, thermal, and mechanical performance properties. Polyimides also exhibit good dielectric properties giving them substantial presence in a number of electrical applications. Zeus polyimide tubing brings these properties and more for both medical and non-medical precision tubing applications. Polyimide tubing provides excellent strength and abrasion resistance. Polyimide tubing also maintains its properties even at very small dimensions. For applications where additional lubricity is needed, PI Glideâ„¢, a PI / PTFE composite, provides a lower coefficient of friction for reduced surface resistance of the tubing. For applications that require enhanced torque, flexibility, strength, pushability, kink resistance, or burst resistance, reinforced polyimide tubing is available. Zeus reinforced polyimide tubing can be produced in full load and half load braid patterns, with various PPI (pick per inch) depending on your specifications. Lower braid densities (low PPI) result in increased pushability, while higher braid densities (high PPI) result in increased flexibility and steerability. Reinforced polyimide tubing is also available in coil configurations with various WPI (wraps per inch) to meet your requirements.",
