    "description": "EDAPLAN® 490 is a VOC-free wetting agent and dispersant for organic and inorganic pigments as well as carbon blacks in aqueous media. It is ideal for the manufacture of flood/float-free aqueous coatings systems (air dry and force dry, 2Ksystems) as well as for the manufacture of aqueous resin-free pigment concentrates. EDAPLAN® 490 stabilizes pigment dispersions and reduces the mill-base viscosity. Gloss, color strength and hiding power are improved and reflocculation is prevented.",
