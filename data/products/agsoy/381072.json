Careful bleaching assures oil with light color making it the oil of choice when AGSOY® is bottled for foodservice or retail distribution. Thorough refining and deodorization guarantee that AGSOY® will not mask the natural flavor profile of your food products. AGSOY® maintains excellent stability and is high in polyunsaturates making it the healthful choice when a liquid vegetable oil is preferred.",
