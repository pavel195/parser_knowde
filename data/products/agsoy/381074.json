    "description": "Ag Processing Lecithin is obtained by degumming filtered crude soybean oil. The wet sludge from the degumming process is dried under vacuum in a thin film evaporator. Lecithin is used in foods because of its emulsifying, wetting, colloidal, antioxidant and physiological properties. Lecithin also performs as a release agent for the baking and plastics industries. Lecithin also serves as a dispersing agent in latex paints and printing inks.",
