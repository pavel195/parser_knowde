    "description": "Albion® Minerals Tabletable (Dicalcium Malate Tabletable)'s buffer capacity leads to significantly less gas creation and acid rebound than with calcium carbonate. It is structured with two moles of calcium attached to one mole of malic acid. Research studies showed Dicalcium Malate was significantly better absorbed than calcium carbonate and maintained elevated serum calcium levels for a much longer period of time. While not water-soluble, the product is soluble at more acidic pH levels.",
