    "description": "Jacking Grease™ ECF™ is safe to use in offshore applications since it is metal free and is formulated to conform to the strict North Sea Environmental Guidelines. It utilizes a water resistant, calcium thickener that is enhanced to improve adhesion and provide greater protection against water wash off, wear, and corrosion. JET-LUBE JACKING SYSTEM GREASE ECF contains specially selected solid bounding lubricants to provide outstanding galling resistance and lubrication properties. The solid boundary additives synergistically combine to produce a superior lubricating film with high-load and low-wear characteristics. The base oil blend of this product is of lower viscosity than most multipurpose greases allowing it greater potential for bio degradation and contains additional anti-wear, anti rust, and antioxidant additives..",
