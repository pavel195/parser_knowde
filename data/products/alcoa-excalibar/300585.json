    "description": "Alcoa Deltalloy® 4032-T651 Aluminum has good machinability and drilling characteristics when using single point or multi-spindle screw machines. It has excellent surface finish using polycrystalline or carbide tooling. Superior wear resistance of the material eliminates the need for hard coat anodizing. It has high strength and low thermal expansion.",
