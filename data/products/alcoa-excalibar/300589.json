    "description": "Alcoa MIC-6 Aluminum Mold Alloy is a blend of the most desirable features of many individual metals. The result is a cast aluminum plate that meets the challenge of product accuracy demanded by todayâ€™s industry. Because of its cast granular structure and stress relieving properties, MIC-6 allows high-speed metal removal with little, if any, of the distortion commonly inherent in long grained wrought, flat-rolled metals. Using proper aluminum machining methods, tolerances in the thousandths can be consistently maintained. MIC-6 is finished to 20 microinches typical on both sides. MIC-6 is produced by continuous casting with each thickness individually cast. By utilizing the most recent developments in casting techniques, the molten metal is continuously fed, eliminating defects from lapses and seams. Thermal gradients are stabilized since heat is removed from both plate surfaces at a balanced rate. The employment of a SNIF filtering and degassing system ensures an end product free of voids and impurities.",
