    "description": "Incozol EH is a urethane bis-oxazolidine latent hardener for use in 1K polyurethane coatings. Used in conjunction with low NCO polyurethane prepolymers, this hardener accelerates the cure of the prepolymer through a moisture triggered mechanism to afford cross-linking benefits to the 1K urethane. In addition, it enhances properties such as through cure development and mechanical strength through the elimination of CO2 gassing in high build, high solids PU systems. Incozol EH confers tolerance to the repeated opening of containers and can be used as a versatile curing agent with 2 or 4 functional mix ratios.",
