    "description": "ALDOCOAT 395 is a one-part silicone elastomeric coating specifically designed for use in low slope roofing applications. Once cured this liquid applied silicone coating provides a durable, seamless, flexible, waterproof membrane that resists lateral movement, shear and will allow for normal expansion and contraction. It provides greater UV protection than similar silicone coatings and offers increased resistance to moisture penetration. It provides excellent long term protection through exceptional weatherability properties.",
