    "description": "ALDOCOAT 400 is a high solids, technologically advanced, fire retardant, thixotropic, 100% acrylic elastomer uniquely formulated for the protection of metal, SPF and a wide variety of other sloped substrates. The proprietary formulation incorporates premium elastomeric acrylic resins, reinforcing laminar pigments and nonmigrating fire retardants to produce a seamless, flexible, durable membrane having exceptional weatherability, ultraviolet and fire resistance. It acts as a breathing membrane allowing trapped moisture vapor to pass through the film while remaining impervious to exterior mass water penetration. The resultant tough, cured film provides good resistance to mechanical damage and chemical attack.",
