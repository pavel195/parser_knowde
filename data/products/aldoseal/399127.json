    "description": "ALDOPRIME 624 is a fast drying rust inhibiting primer designed also as a tie coat for dusty or porous surfaces to improve adhesion of the base coat products. It has been formulated to have exceptional adhesion to a diversity of substrates and penetrates into the surface and provides good anchorage for base coat product in addition to inhibiting rust on oxidized surfaces. Once the finish coat has been applied, ALDOPRIME 624 enhances the properties of topcoat and provides increased resistance to mechanical damage and chemical attack.",
