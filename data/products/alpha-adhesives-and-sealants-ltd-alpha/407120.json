    "description": "Alpha Adhesives and Sealants Ltd Alphaseal 121 High Modulus Acetoxy-Cure Silicone Sealant is a ready to use silicone sealant that cures rapidly on exposure to atmospheric moisture to form a robust rubber seal. Alphaseal 121 has a long life expectancy with excellent weathering resistance properties make it ideal for conditions where wide ranges of temperature, humidity or UV exposure might be present. It is also very versatile and can be used for both interior and exterior applications, with excellent adhesion to glass, ceramics and sanitary ware. It is not suitable for use in ecological systems, such as aquariums, or where potable water may come in to contact with the sealant due to the presence of fungicides within the product.",
