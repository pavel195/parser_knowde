    "description": "Alpha 132 Moisture-Cure Polyurethane Sealant 2 is a high performance flexible polyurethane (PU) adhesive/sealant that is ideal for a wide range of automotive, marine and aerospace applications. The adhesive sealant creates a very strong bond between a range of materials such as carbon fiber, metals, GRP, plastics and rubbers. Alpha 132 is a single part, moisture-cure adhesive/sealant that requires no mixing or activating. It is particularly effective as an adhesive in applications where vibration is likely to occur (such as on a car, truck, boat, plane etc.) owing to its flexibility. Its excellent weathering resistance properties make it ideal for conditions where wide ranges of temperature, humidity, water (including saltwater) or UV exposure might be present.",
