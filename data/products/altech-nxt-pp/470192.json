    "description": "MOCOM Compounds ALCOM® PC 740/4 CC1120-05LD is a polycarbonate base polymer with a special filler/additive system that offers light scattering, high light transmission, and good flow. It has been approved by GS93016 and requires pre-drying conditions of 120°C in a dry air (dessiccant) dryer for 2-4 hours and 120°C in an air circulating dryer for 4-12 hours with a maximum moisture content of &lt;0.02%. For processing injection molding, the melt temperature should be between 270-310°C and the mold temperature should be between 80-110°C.",
