    "description": "MOCOM Compounds ALTECH® PS-HI A 1000/901 WT1260-20 is a polystyrene base polymer with impact-easy release (demolding) properties, designed for injection molding grade applications. It is suitable for use in the Automotive, electrical and electronic, and building and construction market segments, to make injection molded parts such as bezels and housings. Pre-drying conditions should be done in a dry air (dessiccant) dryer at 60-80°C for 2-3 hours, or in an air circulating dryer at 60-80°C for 2-3 hours. Processing injection molding should be done with a melt temperature of 180-260°C and a mold temperature of 10-70°C.",
