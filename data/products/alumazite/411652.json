    "description": "Z-329 is a single component, water base coating formulated to inhibit corrosion. This hard film, water-dispersing coating is designed specifically for application on the interior and exterior surfaces of the fuselage, wing, empennage and other areas, where corrosion from water and condensation have been a traditional threat. Z-329 is a non-flammable, fast drying coating with excellent adhesion that penetrates to protect fasteners, joints and faying surfaces. Unlike wax or oils, Z-329 is environmentally safe and can be sprayed \"on-line\" with a high volume, low pressure spray unit, and without the need of a spray booth. Z-329 can be applied after all other customer finishes, specification primers, top coats and sealants have been applied and cured.",
