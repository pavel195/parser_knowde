    "description": "Tiolon NFX-20 is a non-flammable PTFE lubricant designed for areas requiring release properties and low friction. Tiolon NFX-20 is an excellent release agent and is a superior dry film lubricant for use in injection mold applications. Tiolon NFX-20 can be used to lubricate aluminum anodize by impregnating itself to the oxide layer. This can be a great advantage to extend the wear life, corrosion and chemical resistance, and in addition provide excellent release characteristics. It is a low VOC, Reach compliant &amp; no greenhouse gasses.",
