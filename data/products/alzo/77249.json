    "description": "Polyderm™ PPI-CO-40 is a vegetable derived water soluble polyurethane where the triol is an ethoxylated-hydrogenated castor oil. Polyderm™ PPI-CO-40 exhibits substantivity due to the presence of urethane bond (carbamate bond). It also offers conditioning, lubricity and slip to both skin and hair products. Polyderm™ PPI-CO-40 can be used as an emulsifying agent, a coupling agent and as a surfactant in cosmetic formulations where it leaves a silky feel.",
