    "description": "Absylux® is Westlake Plastics’ family of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). Absylux® is an economical all-purpose engineering plastic exhibiting good dimensional stability, impact strength, and stiffness. Absylux® is a popular choice for prototyping parts where low volumes and easy machining are required. Absylux® can also be painted and is easy to bond with adhesives. Absylux® is FDA Compliant in natural (beige) and black for food applications.Westlake Plastics proprietary compression molding process provides better dimensional stability and resistance to warpage during machining compared to other extruded ABS sheet products in the marketplace.",
