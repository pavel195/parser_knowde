    "description": "Stock shapes extruded from Ardel® resin are specifically formulated to endure the damaging effects of UV light. When exposed to UV light, the material undergoes a molecular change resulting in the formation of a protective layer that essentially serves as a UV stabilizer. This inherent UV stability combined with superior retention of optical and mechanical properties make polyarylate an ideal choice for any application where weathering effects could pose a problem.",
