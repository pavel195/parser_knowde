    "description": "Dispurez 103 is a flexible, toughened polyurethane dispersion that forms films with excellent optical clarity and good chemical and block resistance. Upon application, the water evaporates to yield a tough and flexible transparent film. Films derived from Dispurez® 103 exhibit good chemical, stain and hydrolysis resistance, making them particularly suited for automotive and waterproofing applications.",
