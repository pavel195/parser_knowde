    "description": "BioLoop 68L-PG is a new range of bio-based surfactants containing components that are 100% renewable. This product is based on a hydrophilic loop reacted onto a vegetable oil hydrophobe, and being palm oil free has a good sustainability profile. Unlike many bio-based surfactants, this product offers excellent surfactant properties and can be used as a green alternative to the conventional synthetic nonionics, such as alcohol ethoxylate.",
