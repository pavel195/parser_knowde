    "description": "Pettit Protect® High Build Epoxy Primer Gray 4700 is a heavy duty, two component epoxy coating for use where maximum resistance to fresh or salt water is required. It reduces water absorption in fiberglass hulls, making it an excellent choice for the prevention and repair of osmotic blisters. Pettit Protect’s high-solids formula allows for quicker and easier application with fewer coats necessary for effective protection. Pettit Protect also provides dependable corrosion protection on steel, aluminum, and all other underwater metals. It is ideally suited for commercial and pleasure craft applications and has excellent durability. Pettit Protect white 4100/4101 offers all the benefits of gray Pettit Protect High Build Epoxy Primer in a white color that will not bleed through even the lightest colored bottom paints. Specifically designed for use below white and lightcolored Vivid bottom paints, its use reduces the number of finish coats needed to achieve full color. Pettit Protect has excellent durability in exterior exposures, although, like most epoxies, it will chalk if not top coated.",
