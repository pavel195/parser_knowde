    "description": "Epoxy functional silane used used to improve dry and wet strength in cured composites reinforced with glass fiber rovings. Silanes are used in a variety of industrial applications. Organofunctional Silanes have an organic functional end group and an alkoxy functional end group which allow the silane to act as a bridge between organic materials and inorganic substrates. The organic functional group is matched to the resin system while the alkoxy group provides the reactive site for crosslinking. These materials are useful as adhesion promoters, crosslinking agents, surface modifiers and hydrophobizing agents.",
