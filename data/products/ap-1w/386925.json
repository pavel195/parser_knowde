    "description": "#202 MOLY-LITH™ is a black, thermally stable, lithium 12-hydroxystearate soap grease containing microfine molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), antioxidants &amp; rust inhibitors. #202 MOLY- LITH has a dropping point of 390°F (199°C), is water resistant and displays excellent work stability under high loads, high speeds, shock and vibration. Sub-micron particles of Molybdenum Disulfide, blended into the superior lubricating grease base, contribute to the good load carrying and low friction characteristics.",
