    "description": "Aptek® 2313-Pmf is a one component, premixed-frozen, silver-filled, electrically conductive polymer paste adhesive. It is designed to bond many dissimilar substrates and dissipate device generated heat. Aptek® 2313-Pmf is a 100% solids, solvent free system that will not form voids during cure or outgas after being fully cured. Aptek® 2313-Pmf has excellent reversion resistance and physical stability when subjected to high heat and humidity environments. This system displays higher ionic purity than epoxy systems minimizing the possibility of corrosion on components and circuitry. Aptek® 2313-Pmf Premixed-frozen, snap-cure, electrically conductive, adhesive",
