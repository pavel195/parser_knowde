    "description": "Uvikote™ 7503Lm-Pmf is a low viscosity, one component, premixed frozen liquid, electrically insulating, transparent, urethane coating designed for the encapsulation and protection of electrical/electronic components mounted on printed circuit boards. This system provides an excellent combination of flexibility and low modulus for demanding applications where the management of thermomechanical stresses is required. Uvikote™ 7503Lm-Pmf coating will become tack free when exposed to the proper UV light radiation. The coating will fully post cure in both the exposed and shaded areas in 14 days at 25°C and 50% relative humidity. As an alternative, the post cure for the coating in both exposed and shaded areas may be accelerated with low to moderate heat.",
