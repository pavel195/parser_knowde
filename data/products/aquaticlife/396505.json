    "description": "polyFIBRO® is a scientifically formulated coating devised to tackle the issues of gelcoat finishes traditionally used on fiberglass. Our thermo-polymer coating is long lasting and does not chip, peel or crack like traditional gelcoat and paint finishes. polyFIBRO® is easier to apply than gel coating, gives the appearance of a higher end finish and requires minimal maintenance.",
