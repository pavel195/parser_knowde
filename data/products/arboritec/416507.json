    "description": "Arboritec™ First Coat Ceramic Fortified Waterborne Primer is an 1-component waterborne ceramic fortified primer for indoor wood and parquet floors. The finish is fortified with ceramics thanks to our unique Small Particles Technology. Adding ceramic particles results 30% less petro- chemical raw materials used hence makes First Coat up to 30% more environmentally friendly than competitive brand primers. First Coat is NMP free and has low solvent content. First Coat dries fast, reduces the side bonding effect and the fiber rising. By adding ceramic particles, our waterborne primers dry hard and become very easy to sand. It gives the floor a smooth, rich and enhanced surface. It is the perfect foundation for our waterborne finishes. For indoor use only.",
