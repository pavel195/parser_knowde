    "description": "Arboritec™ Vibrant Deep Ambering Sealer is a deep-ambering ceramic fortified primer for indoor wood and parquet floors. Vibrant ambers and deepens the darker tones and colors in the grain of the wood. Vibrant primer is fortified with ceramics thanks to our unique Small Particles Technology. Ceramic particles make Vibrant up to 30% more environmentally friendly than competitive branded lacquers. Vibrant is NMP free and has low solvent content. Vibrant dries fast, reduces the side bonding effect and the fiber rising. It gives the floor a smooth and rich surface .Ideally, use Arboritec Avenue or Genuine directly over satin; if you choose to use Vibrant, be sure that the stain is ready for a coat of waterborne sealer. For indoor use only.",
