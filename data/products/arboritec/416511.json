    "description": "Arboritec™ Classic+ 1-component Ceramic Fortified Waterborne Lacquer is a 1-component waterborne 100% PU finish for wood and parquet floors in heavy traffic areas. The finish is fortified with ceramics thanks to our unique Small Particles Technology. By adding ceramic particles, our waterborne primers dry hard and become very easy to sand. Classic+ is exceptionally durable to scratches, heel marks and ordinary household chemicals. Adding ceramic particles results 30% less petro- chemical raw materials used hence makes Classic+ up to 30% more environmentally friendly than competitive brand lacquers.",
