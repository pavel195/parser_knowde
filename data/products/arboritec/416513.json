    "description": "Arboritec™ Flowtec 1-component Ceramic Fortified Waterborne Lacquer is a one-component water based polyurethane/acrylate co-polymer finish for wood and parquet floors. Arboritec FlowTec is suitable for residential and light commercial use. The finish has excellent durability and is highly resistant to mechanical wear and commonly used household cleaners and detergents. The finish is fortified with ceramics thanks to our unique Small Particles Technology. Adding ceramic particles results 30% less petro- chemical raw materials used hence makes FlowTec up to 30% more environmentally friendly than competitive brand lacquers.",
