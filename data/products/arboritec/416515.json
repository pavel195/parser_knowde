    "description": "Arboritec™ UVelite Uv-cured 1-component Waterborne Lacquer is a single-component, UV-curable, waterborne finish for wood and parquet floors. Designed for areas of heavy traffic. The durability is higher than most other conventional two-pack water borne PU finishes. UVElite is exceptionally durable to scratches, heel marks and ordinary household chemicals. The finish is fortified with ceramics thanks to our unique Small Particles Technology. Adding ceramic particles to product results 30% less petro- chemical raw materials used hence makes UV Elite up to 30% more environmentally friendly than competitive brand lacquers. UV Elite has passed very strict air quality tests and regulations and it makes UV Elite one of the most environmentally responsible finishes available.",
