    "description": "Arboritec™ Genuine 2-component Ceramic Fortified Waterborne Lacquer floor finish is a ultra matte two-component waterborne 100% PU finish for wood and parquet floors in heavy traffic areas. The ultra matte sheen preserves the natural color and beauty of the wood. It has exceptional flow and leveling with superior adhesion properties for recoating. The finish is fortified with ceramics thanks to our unique Small Particles Technology. Genuine is exceptionally durable to scratches, heel marks and ordinary household chemicals. Adding ceramic particles to product results 30% less petrochemical raw materials use hence makes Genuine up to 30% more environmentally friendly than competitive branded lacquers.",
