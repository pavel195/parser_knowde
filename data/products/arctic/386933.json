    "description": "CB-2™ is an all-purpose, high temperature, lithium 12- hydroxystearate soap grease. Its buttery consistency makes it highly adhesive to metal and it has exceptional mechanical stability. CB-2 is standard in a NLGI 2 grade grease that will accommodate nearly all requirements for a “multipurpose” grease type lubricant. It is also available in other NLGI grades making CB-2 a truly versatile product.",
