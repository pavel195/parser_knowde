    "description": "PEXIDAN® HF X/T is a unique low smoke halogen free flame retardant 90°C wet-rated XL-insulation system curable by moisture. It consists of a silane pre-grafted base compound SX651 and a catalyst masterbatch CM540U. Mixed and extruded in the proper proportions (95:5), the two components result in a material that is crosslinkable by exposure to 90°C hot water. PEXIDAN® HF X/T is REACH and RoHS-compliant and is UL 2885 certified to bear the Halogen Free “HF” designation. PEXIDAN® HF X/T is UL-bulletinized and wire made with this insulation system may be marked as Oil Resistant “PR I” and “PR II”, Gas &amp; Oil Resistant “GR I” and “GR II”, “-40C” and “SUNRES” in all colors. This compound will meet a 105°C dry rating.\r\n",
