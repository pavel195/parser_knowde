    "description": "EXTINITY® 0218-108 is a highly loaded flame-retardant concentrate that can be used for a variety of polystyrene-based applications. This concentrate has been designed to be used in High Impact Polystyrene, but is also effective in the entire styrenic family including general purpose polystyrene grades. EXTINITY® 0218-108 provides excellent flame-retardant performance while having minimal impact on mechanical properties and processibility. Varying the use rate of 0218-108 will permit the final compound to meet UL-94 V-0, V-1 or V-2 requirements.",
