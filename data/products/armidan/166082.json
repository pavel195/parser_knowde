    "description": "PEXIDAN® J/T is a low density flame-retardant XLPE system curable by moisture and consists of a silane pregrafted base compound A-3001 and a flame-retardant catalyst masterbatch CAT-012FR. Mixed and extruded in the proper proportions (60:40), the two components result in a material that is curable by exposure to 70-95°C hot water or even ambient moisture. PEXIDAN® J/T is designed to meet SAE J1128 standards for GXL, TXL and SXL type insulation. PEXIDAN® J/T is halogenated but is RoHS-compliant. \r\n",
