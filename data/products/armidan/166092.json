    "description": "PEXIDAN® X/T-UV is a low density flame-retardant XLPE system curable by moisture and consists of a silane pre-grafted base compound A-3001 and a flame-retardant catalyst masterbatch CAT-005FR-UV1. Mixed and extruded in the proper proportions the two-component system results in a material that is curable by exposure to 70-95°C hot water or even ambient moisture. PEXIDAN® X/T-UV is halogenated but is RoHS-compliant. UL44 type insulation may be marked SUNRES or SR in all colors for sizes of 6 AWG and larger. UL4703 photovoltaic insulation may be marked SUNRES in all sizes and colors",
