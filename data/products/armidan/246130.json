    "description": "PEXIDAN速 SX505:CM493 and SX505:CM497 is a silane crosslinkable rubber compound, curable when exposed to moist conditions. The compound can be processed on largely standard thermoplastic extrusion equipment with good extrusion properties at high output rates. The graft component SX505 is mixed with a crosslinking catalyst\r\nmasterbatch CM493 or CM497 generally in the ratio 95:5. CM497 is a lower strength catalyst masterbatch and is used on thin wall extrusion or to reduce premature crosslinking during processing. The SX505:CM493 or SX505:CM497 systems have passed type-tests for use up to and including 33 kV. PEXIDAN速 SX505 is a zero-halogen material and is used as insulation in Low Smoke Zero-Halogen (LSZH) cable constructions",
