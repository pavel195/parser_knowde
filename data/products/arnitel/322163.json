    "description": "ForTii® Ace MX54B is a high-TG PPA that combines good toughness at low temperatures with chemical resistance. It is designed to have dimensional stability comparable to aluminum and offers high mechanical performance over a broad temperature range, from -35 °C to above 150 °C, in both dry and conditioned environments. ForTii® Ace MX54B is processed using injection molding technology and is heat stabilized. It is 60% glass-reinforced and suitable for structural parts.",
