    "description": "Boratherm™ GA 6 is submicron ground alumina produced by the calcination of carefully selected synthetic aluminum hydroxide (ATH). Boratherm™ GA grades are often used in combination with Boratherm™ SA and Boratherm™ SG grades in order to enhance a formulation’s particle packing and flow properties, resulting in improved thermal conductivity and stability (filler-settling). To guarantee a consistent product quality of the Boratherm™ GA grades, the chemical composition of the raw materials and the product particle size of the final products are closely monitored and kept within a narrow variation.",
