    "description": "FucoVital™ is an innovative proprietary composition for liver health derived from the Phaeodactylum tricornutum microalgae. This type of microalgae is a naturally rich source of fucoxanthin, an orange-brown carotenoid which plays a part in photosynthesis and helps protect the microalgae from oxidative stress. While fucoxanthin provides excellent anti-oxidative benefits like many other carotenoids, its true value goes far beyond. The consumption of algae has always been considered one of the reasons for the superior good health and longevity of certain Asian groups. Recent research institutes from around the world have identified fucoxanthin as a major contributor to the Japanese diet’s health benefits.",
