It gives good adhesion to polypropylene, and is used as paint, adhesion promoter for polypropylene, adhesive for polypropylene. Also it can be easily heat-sealed with untreated or pretreated polypropylene film. So it is used as the main component of printing ink with chlorinated ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer.",
