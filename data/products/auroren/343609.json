    "description": "SUPERCHLON® 803LS is a nearly transparent and slightly elastic thermoplastic resin readily soluble in organic solvents. It gives good adhesion to polypropylene, and is used as paint, adhesion promoter for polypropylene, adhesive for polypropylene. Also it can be easily heat-sealed with untreated or pretreated polypropylene film. So it is used as the main component of printing ink with chlorinated ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer.",
