    "description": "MECHETEC速 PSU (Polysulfone) is an amorphous high performance thermoplastic material that has proven performance at elevated temperatures. Good mechanical properties along with thermal stability allow for its use in load bearing applications over broad temperature ranges. Other notable attributes include flame retardant, excellent radiation resistance, and good chemical resistance. The ability of MECHETEC速 PSU to withstand common sterilization techniques supports its use in numerous sanitary applications such as medical instruments and food processing machinery. MECHETEC速 PSU stock shapes are amber in color and semi-transparent. They machine easily and are available in a full range of heavy gage rod and plate sizes. Formally known as Unifone PSU.",
