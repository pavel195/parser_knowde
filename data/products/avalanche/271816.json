    "slug": "polyslick-uhmw-sheet",
    "description": "Polyslick® UHMW Sheet exhibits the properties of excellent impact strength, abrasion resistance, low coefficient of friction, as well as very good chemical resistance. This industrial grade material is also moisture, stain and odor resistant, and is FDA approved to be used in the food processing industry. The material is ideally suited for wear applications especially in contact with metals. UHMW is widely used in industrial applications such as chute linings, dock bumpers, paper machine parts, and conveyor wear strips and can easily be machined with ordinary wood working tools.",
