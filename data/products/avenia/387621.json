    "description": "Buehnen Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive D3043 LT is slight color fluctuations can occur with adhesives, depending on the raw materials and processes used. this adhesion is characterized by good cohesion and is suitable for assembly applications. the good adhesion properties enable the bonding of low-energy surfaces, such as pe film, over a wide temperature range. the water-clear / transparent color of the pressure-sensitive hot-melt adhesive d53043 lt creates a barely visible glue joint. the low processing temperature enables a significant reduction in energy consumption and thus ensures more resource-saving, more sustainable production. the raw materials used confirm with fda guidelines for the outer packaging of food.",
