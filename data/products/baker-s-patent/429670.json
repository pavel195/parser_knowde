    "description": "Baker's Patent All Purpose Flour is made with traditional white winter wheat. This flour is all natural with no preservatives and is ideal for muffins, pie crust, cookies, brownies, pizza and more. Handcrafters Flour is milled in 50 lb. bags from specially selected wheat for naturally sweeter hard white winter wheat and milled closer to the bran coat to provide superior flavor and water absorption, especially for crusty artisan breads. This all-purpose Handcrafters Flour allows bread a rich, creamy color, an open crumb texture, a hard, not tough, crust, and a nutty, wheat flavor. ",
