    "description": "Cimbar XF is a high purity, natural barium sulfate. Cimbar XF is recommended for use in coatings, especially automotive and industrial primes and topcoats. Additionally, Cimbar XF is often used in high gloss enamels, powder coatings and semi-gloss and gloss latices.Cimbar XF can be used as a filler in polyurethane foams, plastics and plastisols, friction materials, rubbers, adhesives and acoustical compounds and other insulating materials. Cimbar XF is easily dispersable and is often used to impart higher surface gloss, improved hide, improved mar resistance and impact resistance.Cimbar XF also offers excellent sanding resistance, and good scrub resistance to formulations.Cimbar XF is chemically inert and is an excellent choice as a filler in corrosion resistant applications, flame retardant applications, and applications that require excellent weather resistance. Moreover, Cimbar XF exhibits superior thermal stabilty up to 1580 °C. It is therefore recommended for use in heat resistant applications. Cimbar XF helps increase heat distortion temperatures, and reduces compound stickiness.",
