    "description": "Cimbar Barimite XF is an off-white, high purity, natural barium sulfate. Barimite XF is recommended for use in coatings, indcluding automotive and industrial primes and topcoats. Additionally, Barimite XF is often used in high gloss enamels, powder coatings and semi-gloss and gloss latexes.Barimite XF can be used as a filler in polyurethane foams, plastics and plastisols, friction materials, rubbers, adhesives and acoustical compounds and other insulating materials. Barimite XF is easily dispersable and is often used to impart higher surface gloss, improved hide, improved mar resistance and impact resistance. Barimite XF also offers excellent sanding resist ance, and good scrub resistance to formulations.Barimite XF is chemically inert and is an excellent choice as a filler in corrosion resistant applications, flame retardant applications, and applications that require excellent weather resistance. Moreover, Barimite XF exhibits superior thermal stabilty up to 1580 °C. It is therefore recommended for use in heat resistant applications. Barimite XF helps increase heat distortion temperatures, and reduces compound stickiness.",
