    "description": "Barbier Group Barbier Group Manual blown pre stretched film PES-M 7µm makes manual palletizing easier due to the fact that little tension is required and especially as the rolls are lightweight. Its flexibility makes it easy to use for everybody. Its transparency facilitates the identification of pallets in storage and its low noise unwinding makes it pleasant to use. This film shrinks after application in order to stabilize the pallet load without causing its deformation.",
