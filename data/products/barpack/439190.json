    "description": "Barbier Group Barbier Group Automatic Blown Pre Stretched Film PES A 7µm is an easy-use product, already stretched requiring little stretching effort during its application and providing good load stabilization. This film has folded and oscillate-wound edge, giving it a high resistance in both directions as well as a better winding. This product can be used on wrappers with a simple mechanical brake. It reduces film consumption by 50% and the same proportion of waste involved.",
