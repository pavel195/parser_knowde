    "description": "Viton® 1/4\" Rubber was originally introduced over 50 years ago to meet the needs of the aerospace industry for a high-performance elastomer. Since then, the use of Viton® has spread to many other industries, including the automotive, fluid power, appliance and chemical industries. Viton® fluoroelastomer has developed a reputation for its outstanding performance in very hot and extremely corrosive environments. Viton® fluoroelastomer is particularly valued for its excellent heat stability and resistance to aggressive fuels and chemicals. Viton® fluoroelastomer is the most specified fluoroelastomer for fuel systems seals, expansion joints and gaskets.",
