    "description": "Bay Rubber Company NITRILE RUBBER COMMERCIAL GRADE has a number of good properties including good resistance to petroleum oils and aromatic hydrocarbons. NBR or Nitrile Buna-N Rubber is highly resistant to mineral oils, vegetable oils, and many harsh chemicals. It also has good elongation properties as well as adequate resilience, tensile strength and compression set. Applications of nitrile rubber include: fuel tanks, fuel tank gaskets, petroleum gaskets and fuel related rubber applications. Nitrile rubber is now commonly found in laboratories and facilities where testing involving chemicals takes place. Nitrile rubber holds up well in marine diesel tanks and aviation fuel gaskets.",
