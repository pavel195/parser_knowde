    "description": "BENTO GEL TYPE BENTONITE SEALANT is a Sodium montmorrillonite. The use of bentonite as a sealant has spread significantly in toxic and dengerous waste sites, e.g. deposits of low to medium activity radioactive waste. For some time now, bentonites have been used in soil mixtures around dumping sites, in order to decrease their permeability and in that way prevent the release of gasses or leachates generated in the deposit.",
