    "description": "Nicknamed \"blue gold\", lavender has long been used for its aromatic properties in thermal baths and on linen. Native to the western Mediterranean region, it has become the emblem of Provence in France and its surrounding landscapes. This light blue or purplish-blue flower, in the form of small corollas grouped together in spikes, was highly appreciated for its soothing and healing properties.",
