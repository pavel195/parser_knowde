    "description": "BEST Black Malt eXtra (roasted malt) is the darkest malt in the BEST Black Malt series. The intensive roasting process produces colors and flavor components that give the beer a black to deep black color and nuances of black coffee or strong espresso. BEST Black Malt eXtra does not make the foam darker either and complies with the specifications of the German Reinheitsgebot.",
