    "description": "BEST Caramel® Hell – known as BEST Caramel® Light – reinforces the typical “caramely” malt aroma of the beer, giving it a mouth feel that is reminiscent of vanilla and cream toffee. The color of the beer ranges from golden hues to amber, depending on the amount used in the grain bill. The foam and flavor stability of the beer are also improved. As with BEST Caramel® Pils, only the best two-row summer barley varieties are used together with our gentle BEST caramelization technique to make this outstanding specialty malt. BEST Caramel® Hell complies with the purity guidelines of the German Reinheitsgebot. BEST Caramel® Hell is also available in organic quality.",
