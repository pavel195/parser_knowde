    "description": "BEST Melanoidin Light has high levels of Maillard reactions, or melanoidins, which produce a highly intensive aroma and color. As well as giving the beer a rust color, they lend it a unique taste and dry, full-bodied character. Melanoidins can also have a positive impact on the storage life of the beer. As the malt is high in enzymes, it can make up large share of the grain bill. BEST Melanoidin Light complies with the purity guidelines of the German Reinheitsgebot.",
