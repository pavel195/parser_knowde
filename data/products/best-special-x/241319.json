    "description": "BEST Wheat Malt emphasizes the effervescent freshness and typical top-fermented flavor of wheat beer. It is produced exclusively from high-quality brewing wheat. As it has a higher protein content than a Pilsen malt, BEST Wheat Malt is not only suited to producing typical wheat beers, but also enhances the mouth feel and improves the foam of all top-fermented beer styles. The malting process has been adapted to the raw material to guarantee excellent processability. BEST Wheat Malt is also available in organic quality.",
