This non-digestible fiber moves through the upper gastrointestinal tract and is utilized by beneficial bacteria once it reaches the large intestine. The powder is water-soluble, with a light cream color and a bland/flavorless taste. It has no off odors and demonstrates remarkable stability against heat, acid, and microbiological factors.",
