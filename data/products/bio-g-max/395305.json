    "description": "ecoPur™ Multi-Function Cleaner is a 100% biodegradable cleaner, making it environmentally responsible and safe to use on most bathroom surfaces. Designed to accomplish three important aspects of any cleaning job. Our eco-friendly, multi-functional bathroom and toilet cleaner specially formulated for the daily maintenance of most bathroom areas. First, the detergents and light descaling agents cut through filmy residue and remove hard water stains, uric acid and other bathroom soils. Second, a special odor-counteracting ingredient immediately suppresses your worst malodors. In their place is left a cool minty fragrance. Finally, live bacteria cultures and enzymes eat away at organic waste matter to keep bathroom plumbing clear of build-up.",
