These Bacillus bacteria spores (both anaerobic and aerobic) are cultured for the ability to digest waste – quickly, efficiently and without odors! These bacteria are combined with free enzymes using a patented stabilization process. The enzymes work in harmony with bacteria to quickly break down proteins, starch, carbohydrates, animal and vegetable fats – to provide the fastest action available in a liquid digestant.",
