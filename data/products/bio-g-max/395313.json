    "description": "BIO-G2 Multi-Strain Spore Concentrate is formulated specially for grease traps. Lipase enzymes target large particles of oil and grease, breaking them down into smaller particles so that the bacteria can more effectively eliminate the clogs. As grease breaks down, the pH drops. This creates a harsh environment for the helpful bacteria. The Bio-G2 series is a safe and effective choice for grease trap maintenance and designed to work effectively in lower pH ranges found in grease traps.",
