    "description": "BioForm PX® Paraxylene converts plant-derived feedstocks into a BioFormate® product that is analogous to petroleum reformate. Similarly to conventional petroleum reformate, Virent’s Bioreformate product can be used as a gasoline blendstock or processed to high purity aromatic chemicals using conventional aromatics processing technology. Virent’s products are indistinguishable from the petrochemical analogs, except for C-14 dating for bio-content. Using conventional aromatics processing Virent has produced renewable paraxylene, mixed xylenes, toluene, and benzene.",
