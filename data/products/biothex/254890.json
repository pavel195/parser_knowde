    "description": "Anti-ROS® Triol is a classic natural antioxidant, which has many biological activities such as whitening, anti-aging, anti-inflammation and immune regulation. However, the instability and poor water solubility of resveratrol limit its applications in cosmetics. To overcome such disadvantages, JAKA develops an innovative type of resveratrol by using cyclodextrin wrapping technology, which greatly improves the stability and water solubility while maintaining its original biological activity.\r\n",
