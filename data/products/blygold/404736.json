    "description": "Blygold® PoluAl XT is an aluminum pigmented polyurethane coating especially developed for the protection of air-cooled heat exchangers. PoluAl XT stands apart from the rest. It has an excellent chemical and UV resistance. It offers flexibility, excellent adhesion with negligible effect on the heat transfer. Plus it can be applied in a very thin layer, to prevent pressure drop. PoluAl XT combines all these properties with extraordinary corrosion protection.",
