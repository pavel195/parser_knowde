    "description": "Pulverized lime is a specially milled quicklime product for various metallurgical, industrial, chemical and agricultural applications. Final product size is milled to less than 100-mesh. Pulverized lime is also available with an additive for enhanced handling and flowability. High-calcium quicklime is lime made from rich deposits of high-calcium limestone containing less than 5% magnesium carbonate. Calcium oxide (CaO), commonly known as lime or quicklime, is a widely used chemical compound. It is a white, alkaline, and crystalline solid. High-calcium quicklime provides superior chemical performance. It will deliver exceptional performance for acid-neutralization, SO2-absorption, sludge-stabilization or other industrial-alkali applications.",
