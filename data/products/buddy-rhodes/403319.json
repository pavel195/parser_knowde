    "description": "Buddy Rhodes™ GFRC Admixture is a polymer modified, multi-component admixture. When added to locally sourced Portland cement and sand, it will provide strength, premium working characteristics, and durability similar to our GFRC Preblended Mix. The blend is a carefully proportioned mix of chemical and mineral admixtures that combat the inherent weaknesses in concrete. The use of this admixture eliminates the need for curing polymers, pozzolans, defoamers, and shrinkage reducers. Highly refined in composition, this admixture provides maximum performance at minimal weight, reducing shipping costs and other concerns related to comparable products.",
