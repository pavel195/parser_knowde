    "description": "Buddy Rhodes™ ECC Admixture is a polymer modified, multi component additive package that was originally developed for use in seismic zones. When added to locally sourced Portland cement and sand, it will provide strength, premium working characteristics, and durability similar to our ECC Preblended Mix. The strength and ductility of our ECC recipes comes from the combination of particle gradation and the addition of a high dosage of fiber. From a creative standpoint, ECC can be mixed to unique workability, allowing for many variations in finish. The use of this admixture eliminates the need for curing polymers, pozzolans, defoamers, and shrinkage reducers. ECC Admixture provides maximum performance at minimal weight, reducing shipping costs and other concerns related to comparable products.",
