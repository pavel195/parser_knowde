    "description": "Buddy Rhodes™ Water Reducer 555 is a high efficiency polycarboxylate-based superplasticizer in liquid form. It is ideally suited for use when making Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC). Water Reducer 555 has been formulated to provide maximum workability without segregation to concrete. Adding water reducers will increase workability of concrete mixes that have a low water to cement ratio. Maintaining a low water to cement ratio is critical for reaching optimal strength in the cured matrix.",
