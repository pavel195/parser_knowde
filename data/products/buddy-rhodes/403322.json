    "description": "Buddy Rhodes™ Water Reducer 420 is a plasticizer designed to be especially effective with mixes that have a high content of finer sands and particles. It can be used to achieve a homogeneous flow in mixes with high fines, a softer flow in mixes like GFRC, and can soften a mix slightly without imparting too much sag or slump. Water Reducer 420 is often used to temper mixes that have been plasticized with Water Reducer 310 or Water Reducer 205. This combination of water reducers allows the fabricator a wide range of possibilities in responding to environmental conditions.",
