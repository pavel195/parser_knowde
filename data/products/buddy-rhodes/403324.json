    "description": "Buddy Rhodes™ Water Reducer 310 is a unique and powerful powdered polycarboxylate plasticizer designed to significantly reduce water requirements. Water Reducer 310 will make even the most stubborn mixes flowable but must be carefully managed to avoid segregation of mix components. Adding Water Reducers will increase workability of concrete mixes that have a low water to cement ratio. Maintaining a low water to cement ratio is critical for reaching optimal strength in the cured matrix. Water Reducer 310 has 10 times the potency of Water Reducer 205.",
