    "description": "Buddy Rhodes Concrete Products ICT CH Prep Concrete Sealer is our premium reactive densifier and conditioner. CH Prep seals and densifies the micro-channels to improve the abrasion resistance of the concrete. Using CH Prep as part of sealing process works to establish an initial concentration gradient to bring free reactive hydration byproducts to the surface of the concrete, enabling better reactions, and setting the stage for FS Seals. CH Prep is the first step of the ICT sealing system. FS Seals is the second step and Clean and Set is the third and final step.",
