    "description": "Camie® 393 Headliner, Trim &amp; Laminating Adhesive is formulated to bond substrates that require either high bond strength and/or need elevated temperature resistance. Camie® 393 also exhibits excellent green strength and water resistance. Both substrates to be bonded must be sprayed. These substrates can be joined as quickly as 10 seconds - 2 minutes depending on atmospheric conditions; make sure adhesive is tacky to the touch. Maximum open time before bonding is 15 minutes depending on how porous of a substrate is being used; make sure the adhesive is still tacky before bonding. If the adhesive has gone dead, reapply before joining the two substrates together. It is an Aerosol Adhesive.",
