    "description": "L-MET® 100® is a feed grade L-Methionine. Methionine is known as an essential amino acid in animal nutrition. Traditionally, methionine has been available in the form of DL-Methionine or Methionine Hydroxy Analog. Recently L-Methionine, the natural form of methionine, made an entrance into the animal feed market. The latest research highlights that L-Methionine can successfully substitute DL-Methionine, as results show a higher average daily gain and feed efficiency in both broilers and pigs. L-Met 100® has consistently shown a higher relative bioavailability than DL-Methionine.",
