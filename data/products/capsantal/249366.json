    "description": "Selenium 4000 is an Organic selenium is all about L-Selenomethionine. Supplemented selenium can be categorized as organic or inorganic. Organic selenium has an important benefit compared to inorganic selenium due to the fact that L-Selenomethionine is utilized by the body as an amino acid (in the same way as methionine) and is built into animal protein tissue. Via this L-Selenomethionine is able to build up selenium reserves in the body, which ensures a good selenium and anti-oxidant status at all times and secures efficient transfer of selenium to offspring via placenta, milk and eggs.",
