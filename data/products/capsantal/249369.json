    "description": "Vitamins are organic substances that are indispensable to the normal metabolic processes of animals. Vitamins are required in very small amounts and are classified as micronutrients. They are essential to maintain health and performance, and have to be supplied as part of the overall diet. Vitamins can also be ingested as pro-vitamins, which are converted into the corresponding vitamins by the animal organism. In most cases, the animal organism itself is not able to synthesize vitamins.",
