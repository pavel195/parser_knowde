    "description": "Kasomel™ 1110 is a special salt for spreadable cheese with no or very little creaming reaction. Generally, this salt is used for the production of processed cheese in tubes or in cups or in specific shapes for which later hardening must absolutely not occur. It is also very good to process fluid processed cheese for the needs of food industry. Its ion exchange capability is quite good and its creaming reaction is weak. It increases the pH value of processed cheese by 0.3 to 0.4 when used at 3% on the raw materials.",
