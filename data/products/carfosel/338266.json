    "description": "Kasomel™ 2394 has a phosphates blend food grade and an appearance of hygroscopic white powder without foreign matters. It has a strong creaming reaction with a good ion exchange capacity. It is often used together with Kasomel™ 2366, which allows a softer adjustment of pH value without using an acidic correcting salt. This salt is used for processed cheese with a high fat content, either spreadable or sliceable.",
