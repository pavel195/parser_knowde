    "description": "Caroplus® consists of red to reddish brown, free-flowing beadlets containing 10% beta-carotene in a protective matrix. Beta-carotene exists naturally in many green plants and accounts for the yellow to orange color of many different fruits and vegetables. It has a positive effect on the fertility process of cattle, breeding mares and sows. When indoors, animals might suffer from deficiency of beta-carotene and some symptoms may occur as retarded ovulation, silent oestrus, lack of fertility, embryonic death, early abortion as well as lower resistance against infectious diseases. Adding Caroplus® in the animal feed can improve fertility rate, decrease service interval, improve follicle quality and protect the mucosa.",
