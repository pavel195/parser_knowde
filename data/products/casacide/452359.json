    "description": "Casathane速 2125 TF is the tin-free, film-forming, non-reactive urethane prepolymer designed for use in flexo or gravure packaging inks. Casathane速 2125 TF produces a softer film than Casathane 2126 and Casathane 2127 and has been formulated using an alternative to traditional tin- based catalysts. Casathane速 2125 TF is compatible in all proportions with nitrocellulose; offers excellent reducibility with alcohols and esters; and exhibits low odor and high flexibility.",
