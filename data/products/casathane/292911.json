    "description": "Casacide™ T200 is a fully formulated concentrated liquid biocide containing 30 % TCMTB (2- (Thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole) as the active ingredient. CASACIDE T200 does not contain any potentially environmentally hazardous solvents. Upon dilution, the product produces stable water based emulsions, which in combination with the blend of surface active agents, results in excellent surface contact and penetration into a wide range of organic materials. Casacide™ T200 is stable in both acidic and mildly alkali conditions, thus enabling it to be used in a broad range of industrial applications. Casacide™ T200 is a highly effective fungicide that also possesses good bactericidal and algicidal properties.",
