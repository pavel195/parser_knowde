    "description": "ClearCAPS from SWT Group is a transparent, water based, modified acrylic coating which has been developed to cost effectively enhance a roof’s appearance and performance while being applied at very low film thicknesses. ClearCAPS has been formulated with key raw materials which provide a clear durable surface shield on roofing membranes to improve stain and algae resistance and extend the life of the roof in areas of heavy water ponding, weakened substrate or heavy foot traffic. In granulated membrane applications, ClearCAPS increases the adhesive bond of the granules to the substrate to provide additional abrasion and impact resistance while exhibiting superior flexibility to help maintain the integrity of the membrane. The water-based formulation ensures that it’s safe to apply and easy clean-up while having a minimal environmental impact while standing up to extreme weather exposure. A range of gloss finishes are available depending on application and customer preference.",
