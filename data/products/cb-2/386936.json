    "description": "EP BEARING GREASE™ is an all-purpose lithium grease containing naturally-occurring extreme-pressure and boundary lubricants. The additive package enhances the shear stability, lubrication properties and high temperature characteristics of lithium-based grease, making EP BEARING GREASE a versatile, cost-efficient, multi-purpose grease. The extreme pressure additive has the added benefit of reducing acidity created by oxidation of the base fluid and organic additives in high-temperature environments. The result is a stable, high temperature grease that will outperform most lithium soap based greases on the market today.",
