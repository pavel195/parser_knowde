    "description": "MOCOM Compounds ALTECH® PC A 1000/608 WT1005-17LWA is a polycarbonate injection molding grade with laser optimization, easy release (demolding), good flow, and processing stabilized special features. It is used in the automotive, electrical, and electronic market segments, typically in lighting and electrical components applications. Pre-drying conditions should include 120°C in a dry air (dessiccant) dryer for 2-3 hours, and in an air circulating dryer 100-120°C for 4-12 hours depending on the moisture content, with a maximum moisture content of less than 0.02%. Processing injection molding should be done with a melt temperature of 270-310°C and a mold temperature of 80-110°C.",
