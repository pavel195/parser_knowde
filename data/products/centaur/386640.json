    "description": "CENTAUR® C 12x40 is a coconut based alternative to our premium CENTAUR 12x40 product. This liquid phase virgin activated carbon product is not impregnated with metals or alkali yet displays the catalytic functionality of these materials. The product is unique in that it concentrates reactants via adsorption and then promotes their reaction on the surface of the pores. In most cases CENTAUR-C 12x40 can be reactivated and does not present the disposal concerns associated with impregnated carbons.",
