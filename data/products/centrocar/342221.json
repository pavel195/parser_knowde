    "description": "CENTROMID 12 LE / PA 12 LE soft-plastics are often used as flexible hoses for screw and spiral conveyors in the food industry. During the modification with PA 12 LE soft, a special “food compliant” softener is added to the basic polyamide 12 polymer. The modification is also food safe. The resistance of the binding substance is reduced, the application temperature decreases to 130 °C. The tensile strength is reduced to 350 MPa.",
