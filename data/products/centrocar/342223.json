    "description": "CENTROMID 6 E / PA 6 E is a high crystalline thermoplastic, which is comprised of one basic unit. The number 6 indicates the number of C-atoms of the basic molecular structure. PA 6 E possesses high toughness and heat stability. A high elastic-module is reached through hydrogen binding. PA 6 E is applicable within a temperature range of -40 to +160 °C. PA 6 E-parts are often used as bearings, gear wheels, rollers or seals. The BfR-/FDA approval assures physiological safety. PA 6 E is available in the colors natural and black.",
