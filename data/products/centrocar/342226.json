    "description": "CENTROMID 6.6 GF / PA 6.6 GF 30 is reinforced with 30% glass-fibers. This leads to stiffness and increased resistance in the binding substance and an increased heat distortion resistance at the same time. The impact strength is reduced, the tensile strength is increased up to 5.900 MPa. PA 6.6 GF 30-plastics are often used as housings or as spacer units.",
