    "description": "CENTROMID 6.6 / PA 6.6 is a high crystalline thermoplastic, which is comprised of two basic units. The number 6.6 indicates the number of C-atoms of both basic structures of the molecules. PA 6.6 possesses an increased resistance to toughness and wear, as well as an increased resistance to abrasion. Excellent toughness is given even in low temperatures. PA 6.6 is applicable within a temperature range of -30 to +180 °C. PA 6.6 plastics are often used as track rollers, rope pulleys or gear racks. The BfR-/FDA approval assures physiological safety. PA 6.6 is available in the colors natural and black.",
