    "description": "CENTROLEN / PP GF 30 is reinforced with 30% glass-fibers. This leads to stiffness and increased resistance in the binding substance and an increased heat distortion resistance at the same time. The impact strength is reduced, the tensile and bending strength is increased up to 6.500 MPa and/or 5.500 MPa. PP GF 30-plastics are often used as fan blades or air filter housings.",
