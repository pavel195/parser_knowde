    "description": "CENTROMID 6 E FG / PA 6 E FG is a high crystalline thermoplastic, which is comprised of one basic unit. The number 6 indicates the number of C-atoms of the basic molecular structure. PA 6 E FG possesses high toughness and heat stability. A high elastic-module is reached through hydrogen binding. PA 6 E FG is applicable within a temperature range of -40 to +160 °C. PA 6 E FG-parts are often used as bearings, gear wheels, rollers or seals. The EU-VO 10/2011-/FDA approval assures physiological safety. PA 6 E FG is available in the color natural.",
