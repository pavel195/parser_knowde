    "description": "CENTROCAR CENTROCARB GF / PC GF 30 is reinforced with 30% short-glass-fibers. This leads to stiffness of the composite material and an increased heat distortion resistance at the same time. The effect of tension tears is reduced. The maximum short-term highest applicable temperature is increased to 140 °C. Due to the outstanding electrical properties, PC GF 30-plastics are often used as insulation parts in the electronics industry.",
