    "description": "CENTROLEN / PP-H is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic, but possesses higher resistance, stiffness and melting temperature with low density. The dynamic stability is equally high. PP-H is applicable within a temperature range of +2 to 130 °C. PP-H is used in apparatus engineering and in the chemical industry. The BfR-/FDA approval assures physiological safety. PP-H is available in the colors natural and gray.",
