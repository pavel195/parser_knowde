    "description": "CepSinol® - e (MB*) 1214/1 is a fatty alcohol with a relatively low ethylene oxide content, which results in low solubility in water. It is primarily utilized in the production of ethoxy-sulfated alcohols. These ethoxy-sulfated alcohols, when they contain a higher ethylene oxide content, become water-soluble and are directly employed as non-ionic surfactants in various applications. This versatile range of surfactants finds use in a wide array of products, including laundry detergents, household cleaners, industrial and institutional cleaning formulations, and applications related to agriculture, textiles, and the oil industry. These surfactants play a critical role in enhancing the performance and cleaning properties of these products.",
