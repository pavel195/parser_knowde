    "description": "Cerablak® HTP is a high-emissivity spray-on coating that provides thermal insulation and environmental protection. Utilizing a conventional off-the-shelf spray gun and a proprietary slurry feedstock solution, Cerablak® HTP is deposited as an inorganic coating with a brief thermal treatment after deposition. The black version of Cerablak® HTP is particularly unique in blocking radiant heat. Thermal conduction by radiation becomes critical above 700°C and Cerablak® HTP can provide durable thermal protection in oxidizing, reducing, and even vacuum environments such as in semiconductor manufacturing or space exploration.",
