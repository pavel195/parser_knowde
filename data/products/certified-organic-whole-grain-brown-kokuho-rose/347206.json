    "description": "Kokuho Rose® is a Japanese style medium grain rice, developed in the 1950s specifically for our microclimate and soil type. Friction milled white, with a delicate floral flavor and a gently sweet afternote, it's light on the palate. Touted by gourmets as the perfect steamed table rice, its tender and sticky texture makes it also outstanding for sushi. Versatile and appropriate for other preparations dependent on a similarly starchy profile such as Italian risotto and Spanish paella. Less than 2% broken kernels. Certified Kosher (KSA), GMO-free (Non-GMO Project Verified), Gluten-free. Pure unadulterated rice – no additives of any sort.",
