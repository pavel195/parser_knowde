For application to wood surfaces, contact manufacturer. They have excellent penetration and bond strength to properly prepared surfaces and are UV resistant with flexible properties. They have good splash and chemical-spill-resistant properties involving commercial and household cleaners, pool water treatment products, and hot tires. The UF version has a high degree of flexibility when compared to standard polyaspartic and is suitable for areas such as parking decks or other areas subject to movement or needing elongation in excess of 100%.",
