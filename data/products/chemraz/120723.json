    "description": "Sanitary gaskets made from Fluoraz® 799 proivde a level of performance in SIP and CIP systems that surpasses all other elastomers. While EPDMs and FKMs can provide a seal for extended periods, chnages in physical properties can have adverse effects beyond simple volume swell. A decrease in hardness or drop in modulus signals a reduction in compressive strength. If a sanitary gasket is retorqued to the installation specifications, the gasket will be compressed at a greater level than desired, resulting in increased intrusion into the proecess stream. An increased in hardness/modulus and a drop in elongation means embrittlement. The seal will be undertorques, resulting in either leaks or cracking.",
