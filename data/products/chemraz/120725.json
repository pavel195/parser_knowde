    "description": "Fluoraz 890 is formulated for use in sanitary gaskets where both USP and FDA compliance is required, making it an excellent compound for both pharmaceutical and other hygienic fluid handling applications such as seals for brewery applications. Fluoraz 890 metal and TOC extractable are an orde of magnitude lower than premium competitive FKM formulations, ensuring little or no contamination into the process stream. Fluoraz 890 also meets the extrative requirements of both 21 CFR 177.2600 (e), (f) and 21 CFR 177.240 (d) extraction testing for perfluoroelastomers. Fluoraz 890 sanitary gaskets by Greene, Tweed are designed for minimal intrusion.Fluoraz 784 is also available in O-rings and custom shapes where a low durometer hardness is desired.",
