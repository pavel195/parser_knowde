    "description": "WR® 525 is a thermoplastics composite consisting of carbon fiber in a PEEK™ matrix. WR provides excellent chemical resistance, non-galling and nonseizing properties, impact resistance and thermal shock and hydrolysis resistance.WR 525 allows the pump user to increase pump efficiency by running tighter wear rings clearances while decreasing potential pump damage when pumos are cavitated or experience down-line bearing failures.",
