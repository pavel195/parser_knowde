As a silica with particles in the range of 120 um, it is used to replace polyethylene beads in exfoliating skincare formulations such as shower gels and facial cleansers. In addition to its scrubbing effect, its sponge-like structure can also transport liquid ingredients into the cosmetic formulation. Its microbiological quality is guaranteed through regular and stringent monitoring.",
