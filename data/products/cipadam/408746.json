    "description": "CIPADAM® S-40 is a clear, penetrating, breathable sealer that contains a 40 percent solution of Silane in an alcohol carrier. CIPADAM S-40 chemically reacts with the concrete substrate and most masonry surfaces to produce a long lasting water repellent effect. This material's small molecular structure allows for maximum penetration into any siliceous material to form an alkali resistant polysiloxane.",
