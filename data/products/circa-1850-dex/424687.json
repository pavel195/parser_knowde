    "description": "Circa 1850速 Wood Conditioner is formulated to penetrate into the wood fibers to provide a uniform surface for staining. Circa 1850速 Wood Conditioner prevents the blotching and spotting that results from inconsistent stain absorption in areas of loose and tight grain density. Uneven staining is most common on soft woods, such as pine, birch,and spruce. Always use Circa 1850速 Wood Conditioner prior to staining end grains.",
