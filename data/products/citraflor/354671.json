    "description": "FloraRez® DR95 is a polymerized rosin that is produced through the partial dimerization of gum rosin using a catalytic process. This results in a resin with an elevated softening point while still maintaining the acid functionality of rosin. FloraRez® DR95 is pale, thermoplastic, crystallization-resistant, and less prone to oxidation compared to unmodified rosin. Its high acid functionality promotes specific adhesion to various substrates.",
