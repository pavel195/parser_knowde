    "description": "FloraRez® PR is gum rosin that has undergone partial hydrogenation. It is a pale-colored resin with excellent thermal and oxidative stability characteristics due to the hydrogenation process. Compared to unmodified gum, wood, and tall oil rosins, it offers a higher degree of color and solubility stability for the derivative products produced from it.",
