    "description": "ROOFDX GOLD™ is a highly durable, rubberlike waterproofing coating with a stunning golden finish and exceptional elasticity. This remarkable \"liquid gold\" coating can be applied to all common roofing substrates and will give the roof a golden, metallic, rich luster at a fraction of the cost of gold leaf. ROOFDX GOLD™ can be sealed with a topcoat of CLEARCOAT 44 to provide an extra shiny, brilliant appearance and to maintain the bright finish; otherwise, a natural patina will develop over time.",
