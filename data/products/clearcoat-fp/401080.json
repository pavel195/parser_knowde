    "description": "ROOFDX SL™ is a siliconmodified, aliphatic polyurethane coating that is tough, flexible, and longlasting. ROOFDX SL has the appearance of lead coated copper but does not contain any lead. ROOFDX SL™ is used as a finish coat over Andek products such as POLAROOF NW, POLAROOF RAC, and ROOFDX SUPER, and it may be used over ROOFDX COPPER in situations where the most similarity to lead coated copper is required. ROOFDX SL is a dense complex barrier coating that combines a unique mineral, micaceous iron oxide, with a blend of flaked metals, including stainless steel, to protect against weathering, corrosion, and chemical degradation. ROOFDX SL's surface develops a silicon hammer finish that is extremely damage resistant and dirt resistant.",
