    "description": "Cinnulin PF® is a unique proprietary, patented cinnamon extract, that has research to support its functions including blood sugar and blood pressure. Cinnamon has a long history of use for flavoring, as a spice or preservative, and for medicinal purposes. In an in vitro study with cinnamon’s doubly linked Type-A polymers, glucose metabolism improved twenty-fold. After years of investigation, Cinnulin PF® was developed as a water-soluble extract from the bark of the cinnamon tree using a proprietary extraction process called Controlled Polymer Purification Technology (CPPT). This process allows the important, biologically active compounds to be isolated from the potential toxins from the whole cinnamon.",
