    "description": "CM-Glucan Granulate is a derivative of ß-(1,3) and ß-(1,6) glucan, a natural yeast polysaccharide featuring immune-stimulating properties. ß-Glucan that is isolated from yeast is insoluble in water and therefore not suitable for topical use. Consequently, Mibelle Biochemistry has developed a process to offer CM-Glucan Granulate, a biologically active ß-glucan derivative that maintains the same biological activity as ß-glucan, is highly purified and also water-soluble.Benefits:\nIncreases the skin's self-protecting capacity.\nAccelerates skin recovery.\nRestores the skin's moisture barrier.\n",
