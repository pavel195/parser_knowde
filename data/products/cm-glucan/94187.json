    "description": "Lipobelle™ Soyaglycone is a liposomal preparation of genistein, which is the biologically active form of the most abundant isoflavone in soy. Genistein not only greatly stimulates the production of collagen but it also prevents its degradation by matrix metalloproteinases. Studies have proven that Lipobelle™ Soyaglycone increases skin thickness (by 12% compared to the placebo) and that it also has a lifting effect. Furthermore, Lipobelle™ Soyaglycone was shown to make the skin appear five years younger thanks to it ensuring a reduced appearance of wrinkles.Benefits:\nDelivers a visible lift.\nReduces lines and wrinkles.\nRe-densifies and firms the skin.\nSkin appears 5 years younger.\n",
