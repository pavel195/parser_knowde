    "description": "Cola®Terge FACC is a fatty acid amido complex, which provides excellent wetting and detergency properties in medium and high electrolyte-based cleaning formulations. This detergent concentrate offers superior cost/effectiveness versus systems requiring the use of hydrotropes. Its foaming characteristics are low to moderate, producing a lower and less stable foam than ethoxylated nonionics. Cola®Terge FACC is ideal for use in heavy-duty floor cleaners and wax strippers. Product should be stored between 40°F and 120°F to maintain stability. Based upon chemical composition the product is expected to be completely biodegradable.",
