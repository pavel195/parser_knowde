    "description": "Colmant Coated Fabrics Nitrile (NBR) Rubber Sheet was first developed in 1941 in a project meant to find an oil resistant rubber. However, NBRâ€™s oil resistance depends on the grade of acrylonitrile. The higher the grade of acrylonitrile the better is resistance to oil and fuel. However, as the grade of acrylonitrile increases, the endurance to low temperatures decreases. NBR has good abrasion resistance nonetheless its physical properties are moderate in comparison with the Natural Rubber.",
