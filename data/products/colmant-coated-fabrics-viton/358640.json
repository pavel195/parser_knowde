    "description": "Colmant Coated Fabrics Silicone Sheet are ideal for high and low temperature applications. Electrical properties are excellent and resistance to weathering and ozone attack is outstanding. It is not resistant to super-heated steam. Physical properties are generally low but are at least retained at higher temperatures. Gas permeability is very poor as is resistance to petroleum based fluids. Silicone rubbers are expensive in comparison to most other rubbers. Food Quality/FDA compliant grades are available for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",
