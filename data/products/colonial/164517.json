    "description": "Cola速Wet sulfosuccinates, chemically classified as dialkyl sulfosuccinates, are anionic surfactants that provide a wide variety of functional properties that include surface and interfacial tension reduction, wetting, dispersing, emulsifying, penetrating, and solubilizing.\r\n\r\nCola速Wets are suitable for use in a broad range of applications such as wetting agents, in cosmetics, detergents, agricultural, mining and textile products, as well as emulsifiers/dispersants in water treatment, paint, ink and polymerization formulations.\r\n\r\nCola速Wet MA-80 surfactant is an anionic surface tension depressant and an emulsifying, dispersing and solubilizing agent exhibiting high electrolyte tolerance. It promotes penetration and spreading of organic liquids as films.",
