    "description": "Nitoseal® MS300 is a one part, high modulus sealant based on hybrid silyl modified polyether technology. It has a rapid rate of cure and forms a tough elastomer capable of supporting heavy wheel loads. Nitoseal® MS300 may be applied between 6mm and 20mm wide, for internal trafficked flush joints and up to 40mm wide, for non-trafficked / recessed trafficked joints. In most cases it is recommended to form a sealing slot with a square cross- section, subject to a minimum 10mm depth. To ensure the sealant operates within its stated movement accommodation capacity the sealing slot widths should be designed in accordance with the recommendations of BS6093.",
