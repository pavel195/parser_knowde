    "description": "Thioflex 600 is particularly recommended for use in high-rise buildings and other applications where access for subsequent maintenance will be difficult and the risk of early movement failure must be minimized. It is also suitable for sealing joints in brickwork, retaining walls, basements and subways. Thioflex 600 is available in gun and pouring grades. The gun grade is ideal for general application. It is packed in a ready to mix, 2.5 liter tin containing the base and curing agent in the correct proportions. The pouring grade for joints in horizontal surfaces is supplied in 5 liter packs with the base and curing agent in separate tins. Thioflex 600 pouring grade is recommended for initial sealing of expansion joints and stress relief joints in floors and sealing other horizontal surfaces.",
