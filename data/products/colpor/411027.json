    "description": "Nitoseal速 PU220 is a two part polyurethane formulation which is blended with high grade pitch which cures to form elastomeric, highly resilient seals with excellent recovery properties. It does not exhibit the characteristic disadvantages of conventional bituminous or tar based compounds such as embrittlement, thermo-plasticity and cold flow tendencies. Cured Nitoseal速 PU220 seals are watertight and highly resistant to weathering and aging. Nitoseal速 PU220 is supplied as a black, gun grade sealant suitable for both vertical and horizontal joints.",
