    "description": "Conductive Black CP1™ Polyimide Lower RF loss than other black and conductive black polyimides \nNeXolve’s Conductive Black CP1™ Polyimide is filled with carbon nanoparticles to produce a conductive black polyimide material with lower RF loss than other black and conductive black polyimides. Conductive Black CP1™ Polyimide exhibits very high optical density (&gt;4) and light blocking. It is useful in applications requiring static dissipation, as it exhibits ESD-level surface resistivity. Conductive Black CP1™ Polyimide also exhibits high emissivity, surpassing 0.80 at 1 mil thickness. This material can be sprayed and cast into a variety of shapes using low-temperature curing (&lt; 100 °C) for solvent removal. Conductive Black CP1™ Polyimide is available as a liquid casting resin or film product.",
