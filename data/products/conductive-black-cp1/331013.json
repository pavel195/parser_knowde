    "description": "Novastrat® 905 Polyimide  has High temperature polyimide with essentially zero coefficient of thermal expansion  \nNovastrat® 905 is a high temperature polyimide film with essentially zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). Because of this unique property, Novastrat® 905 has been successfully used in demanding optics, satellite and industrial applications that are exposed to severe temperature fluctuations. Novastrat® 905 is the recommended grade for applications that require essentially zero CTE and stable properties across a wide range of operating temperatures. Novastrat® 905 is available as a film in sheet form, or liquid resin for spray or flow casting operations. As a liquid, it bonds well to metals and metal oxides, and is supplied with and without a variety of internal adhesion promoters.",
