    "description": "Safe‘n Easy® Porous Surface Graffiti Remover easily and effectively removes graffiti from unpainted porous masonry substrates. This innovative formula delivers high performance without surface damage. Perfect for porous surfaces that have been defaced by aerosol spray paints, crayons, markers, and unwanted paints and coatings. Safe ‘n Easy Porous Surface Graffiti Remover is a non-drip, deep penetrating gel formulation that dissolves graffiti within 15 - 30 minutes. Ideal for restoration of historic stone and porous surfaces, salvaging the substrate and avoiding traditional damages from scraping, grinding and various blasting techniques. For best results, remove with a pressure washer; use an oscillating tip and low pressure. If a water or power source is not available, a compressor and airless paint sprayer can be used. Alternatively, use a nylon scrub brush to agitate the surface, then rinse with a spray bottle.\r\n",
