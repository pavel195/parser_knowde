    "description": "ME8630-RC is an extra fine silver filled 100% solid rapid curing die- attach for finer pitch application. It is a low stress, low temperature curable die-attach adhesive paste. This single component, silver filled paste is electrically and thermally conductive. It is highly thixotropic with outstanding compatibility for bonding different adherends. The relatively medium Tg and modulus made it suitable for bonding both smaller and relatively large devices. ME8630-RC has been designed to eliminate bleeding on both silver plated copper and alloy 42 lead frames. It maintains more than 150 psi bond strength at 250Â°C for high temperature wire-bonding.",
