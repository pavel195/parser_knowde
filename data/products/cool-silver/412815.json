    "description": "Tack-Free ESP8350 is a reworkable, silver-filled, epoxy film adhesive. It is designed for bonding component and substrate to a mismatched substrate or carrier. This novel, B-staged electrically conductive adhesive offers excellent reworkability from 80 to 150Â°C. The dry, tack-free handling of the film makes it suitable for an automated assembly. ESP8350 has excellent thermal conductivity. Its low Tg adhesive imposes minimum thermal stress on bonded parts during thermal cycling or shock testing. This frilm is reinforced with 1.5 mil fiberglass.",
