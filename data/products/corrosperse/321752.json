    "description": "Wayncor™ 205 - Corrosion Inhibitive Pigment is an anti corrosion pigment that utilizes a calcium ion exchange mechanism to inhibit the corrosion process. Its near neutral pH allows it to be used in a wide variety of formulas without a negative impact on paint stability. The fine Hegman grind (6.5 minimum) permits its use in thin film applications (4 – 10 microns) such as coil coatings and in more traditional industrial applications where the dry film thickness is higher. This fine Hegman value also allows the product to be high speed dispersed. The Wayncor™ 205 mechanism works well on both ferrous and non-ferrous substrates. Wayncor™ 205 can be used as the sole corrosion inhibitor or synergistically with other inhibitive technologies.",
