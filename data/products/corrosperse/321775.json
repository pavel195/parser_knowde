    "description": "Waynflash™ 110 is a liquid flash rust inhibitor which contains sodium nitrite as part of its flash rust inhibition matrix. It is a highly effective inhibitor for the flash rusting on ferrous substrates (such as galvanized steel) during the aqueous paint phase. Typical used levels range from 0.25 – 1.0% max., based upon total formula weight. It is highly versatile and can be used in any water based systems. Waynflash™ 110 exhibits good paint stability and can be incorporated at any stage of paint manufacturing. It is both HAPS and APEO free.",
