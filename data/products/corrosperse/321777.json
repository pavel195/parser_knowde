    "description": "Waynflash™ 115 is a liquid flash rust inhibitor that is based on WPC’s nitrite free chemistry. It is a highly effective inhibitor against flash rusting on ferrous substrates (such as galvanized steel) during the aqueous paint phase. Typical use levels range from 0.25 – 1.0% based upon total formula weight. It can be used in any water based primer or DTM system. Waynflash™ 115 exhibits good paint stability and can be incorporated at any stage of paint manufacturing. It is both HAPS and APEO free.",
