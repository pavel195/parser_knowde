    "description": "Ximenia called Ximenia americana, belongs to the family Oleacaceae. The fruit was traditionally used because of its high concentration of vitamin C and bark to treat toothache, mouth infections and stomach upset The oil extracted from seeds is mainly used as an emollient, hair oil, conditioner and skin softener, in the manufacture of soap, and as a component of lipsticks and lubricants. 1 With very stable properties, this oil is not well known in cosmetics and deserves to be highlighted.",
