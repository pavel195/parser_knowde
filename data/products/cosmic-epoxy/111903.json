    "description": "DAP K77/6220F is a high-quality diallyl iso-phthalate molding compound that combines short glass fibers and flame retardant properties. Supplied in granular form, it is designed for ease of use in molding applications. This compound has excellent flow characteristics, making it easy to pour and mold in standard compression, transfer, or injection equipment. Its flame retardant properties make it suitable for applications where fire resistance is a critical factor, such as in the production of components for fire safety equipment or other high-temperature environments.",
