    "description": "Cosmic Epoxy E4920 is a mineral-filled epoxy molding compound available either in granular form or preformed in various sizes and weights. It features excellent moisture resistance, thermal cycling stability, and remarkable moldability. Furthermore, parts molded from this material do not support fungus growth, and it is specifically designed for the encapsulation of passive devices, including capacitors, inductors, diodes, and rectifiers.",
