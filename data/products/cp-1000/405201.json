    "description": "PERCO® CATALYST is a fixed-bed Mercaptan (RSH) conversion process for liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon streams. The PERCO® CATALYST converts light Mercaptans to odorless, non-corrosive disulfides. The process is commercially proven to meet product and pipeline specifications e.g. copper strip test, negative doctor test, or low Mercaptan sulfur (ppm). PERCO® CATALYST offers low pressure-drop, long bed life, simplistic in its design and operates over a broad range of flow rates and temperatures. PERCO® CATALYST is a reliable long-term solution for the reduction of mercaptans.",
