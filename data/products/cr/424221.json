    "description": "VMQ 50 B 3 M1 Silicone rubber is a high-performance elastomer that is ideal for high and low-temperature applications. Silicone Rubber’s unique structure provides material flexibility, and it is consistent over a wide range of temperatures thanks to its chemical characteristics.The unique structure of silicones provides material flexibility which is consistent over a wide range of temperaturesMain advantages of silicone rubber are its combined chemical and heat resistanceSilicones offer a typical working temperature ranging from -60°C up to +250°CThe electrical properties of silicone are excellentIts resistance to weathering and ozone attack is outstanding",
