    "description": "CRACKBOND® V65 HI-MOD Class B is a two-component, deep penetrating, fast cure, high strength epoxy coating that will reduce intrusion of moisture and water soluble materials into concrete. The ultra-low viscosity allows superior substrate wetting that allows better penetration into static cracks of concrete surfaces. It may be successfully applied and cured at temperatures between 40°F and 105°F (4°C and 41°C).",
