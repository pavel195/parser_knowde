    "description": "CREASPERSE® UV DUO is a range of ready-to-use pre-dispersed mineral UV filters developed for sun care products. Each pre-dispersion combines two sizes of nanofine Titanium dioxide crystals. Creasperse® UV DUO have maximum concentrations of solids, hence it is easy to obtain a perfect balance between a SPF, an UVA ratio and an application more or less transparent. Minerals UV filters are dispersed in a synthetic or natural photostable emollient: Creasperse® UV DUO AF is based on Alphaflow®, a pure, hypoallergenic and inert emollient.",
