    "description": "HCR®-IND is a proprietary, eco-friendly Modified Acid™ that minimizes the hazardous exposure levels, corrosion rates and negative HSE properties of commonly used acids while delivering excellent performance penetrating, solubilizing and removing scale. HCR®-IND is a modified acid that provides superior performance to commodity acids for a wide range of water treatment and industrial cleaning and descaling applications. HCR®-IND has similar solubilizing abilities to strong acids with a premium HSE profile so it can be effectively used in place of conventional strong and weak acids such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric and citric.",
