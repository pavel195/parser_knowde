    "description": "CTECH™ 7-111-2 has both UV/ Visible and low temperature cure systems to enable quick “fixture” of components by UV hardening of filets followed by rapid thermal cure of the shadowed areas. Alternatively, heat alone can be used. The material is thixotropic for easy dispensing and will stay on the part without spreading. The cured product is of low modulus but does not deflect greatly upon heating in order to bond disparate surfaces such as; gold, stainless steel, aluminum, “Alclad”, glass, ceramics and other oxide surfaces as well as FR4 surfaces.",
