    "description": "Noovista Go L-Valine can be used without supplementation with L-valine, many feed rations for piglets, broilers and for high-productivity sows during lactation are deficient in valine. Only the addition of L-valine makes it possible to optimize feed rations with low crude protein levels, taking into account the ideal protein. As a result, the crude protein content in feed can be reduced by 1 to 2 percentage points for piglets and by 0.5 to 1 percentage point for broilers.",
