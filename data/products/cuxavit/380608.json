    "description": "Cuxavit Beta Carotene is the precursor of vitamin A, which is essential for many physiological functions in the body, such as vision, epithelial membrane development, fertility, embryonic development and the immune system. Regardless of its role as a pro-vitamin A, β-carotene has an important impact on fertility, including by stimulating progesterone synthesis. In addition, β-carotene protects the embryo from damage caused by free radicals thanks to its antioxidant effect.",
