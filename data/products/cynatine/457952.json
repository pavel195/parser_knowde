    "description": "LC Ingredients Organic Plant Based Multivitamin is produced solely for multivitamins production and is blended with other organic independent vitamins and minerals. B-complex is manufactured in two stages. The first stage is the hydrolysis of B vitamins from food complexes, and the second stage involves mineral recovery using amla and coconut aminos. The recovered hydrolysates from the two stages are evaporated and vacuum dried to obtain a BM-complex blend, which represents B vitamins and minerals. Upon completion of the BM-complex blend, other independent vitamins/minerals are blended as per the ratio using a V-cone blender before it is sifted and packed.",
