    "description": "NIPPOLLAN N-972 is newly developed polycarbonate diol (PCD) with added flexibility to the initial versions of NPU’s PCD (NIPPOLLAN 980, 981) products. NPU’s initial PCD products possessed high durability and stiffness due to its straight aliphatic carbonate chain structure, and have been widely applied in synthetic leather and various other applications. However, the lack of flexibility was one of its disadvantages. Therefore, a new series of PCD were developed which possessed the same durability but also with added flexibility property. ",
