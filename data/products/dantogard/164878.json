    "description": "Bardac® 2240 Antimicrobials contain the active substance Didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DDAC). The active is a cationic molecule offering good surfactant properties and can be formulated to- gether with non- ionic and/or amphoteric surfactants. DDAC has a broad antimicrobial efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and enveloped viruses. High antimicrobial efficacy is maintained even at low temperatures and in the presence of organic soil, such as blood and protein. In formulated products, DDAC is stable over a wide range of pH levels and is used in a number of applications such as food processing, institutional, veterinary, healthcare areas and medical devices. Single-active DDAC products are available at different active concentrations and solvent combinations.",
