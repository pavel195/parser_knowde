    "description": "DAP D72/6120F is a versatile diiallyl ortho-phthalate molding compound, filled with short glass fibers and featuring flame retardant properties. Supplied in a free-flowing granular form, this compound is well-suited for a variety of molding applications. It can be easily molded using compression, transfer, or injection equipment and can be preformed with ease. An important distinction is that it has passed NASA outgassing tests, indicating its suitability for applications with stringent outgassing requirements, particularly in industries like aerospace where such standards are critical.",
