    "description": "Fomax® is a powerful detergent which optimizes the disinfection of livestock buildings thanks to its foam with strong penetrating and descaling power. The long hold of its foam allows it to act longer than conventional detergents. Its concentration of OH- (hydroxide) ions gives it a significant active alkalinity, which makes it a powerful and very effective detergent.",
