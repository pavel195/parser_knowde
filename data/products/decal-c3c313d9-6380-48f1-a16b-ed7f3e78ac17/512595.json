    "description": "Cardolite® Lite 2020 is a low viscosity multipurpose resin modifier designed for use in coatings, adhesives, and other applications. It features a long hydrophobic aliphatic side chain of the cardanol molecule, providing excellent early water resistance and corrosion protection. It can be used as an epoxy diluent, allowing for enhanced workability and higher solids in formulations without sacrificing performance properties. It can also be used in alkyds, urethanes, and acrylics.",
