    "description": "USALCO Sodium Aluminate Solution (45%) is an economical source of highly reactive alumina manufactured by dissolving alumina tri‐hydrate (ATH) into sodium hydroxide and water. USALCO 45 is also stabilized to prevent alumina from precipitating. The use of only stringently selected raw materials and state‐of‐the‐art manufacturing practices ensures that USALCO 45 is of the highest quality. USALCO 45 meets the specifications of the American Water Works Association Standard B405‐16 and complies with the requirements of NSF/ANSI/CAN 60: Drinking Water Treatment Chemicals ‐Health Effects at a maximum dosage of 89 mg/L.\r\n",
