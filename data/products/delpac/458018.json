    "description": "USALCO Ferric Sulfate (60%) is a highly effective liquid coagulant based on trivalent iron (Fe3+). It is made by reacting high-purity iron ore with sulfuric acid. The product can be used to clarify both potable water and wastewater, removing turbidity, color, phosphate, and heavy metals. It is used in lime softening processes and for conditioning sludge. It also has the ability to control hydrogen sulfide, reduce odor, and prevent corrosion.",
