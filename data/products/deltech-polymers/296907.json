    "description": "Deltech Vinyl Toluene (VT) is a mixture of methylstyrene isomers, with approximately 55% meta and 45% para isomer distribution. This reactive monomer readily polymerizes to form a high-clarity, colorless polymer with excellent electrical and physical properties. In many applications, VT demonstrates superior properties compared to styrene monomer.\r\n",
