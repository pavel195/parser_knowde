    "description": "Deltech Crystal Polystyrene 147 is a homopolymer of styrene, produced through the polymerization of styrene. It is primarily used in the manufacturing of plastic products. This polymer is in a solid physical state and appears clear in color. It is insoluble in water and demonstrates stability. Importantly, there is no occurrence of hazardous polymerization with this product. Furthermore, It is an inert substance with low volatility and is non-biodegradable. It also possesses a low potential for bioaccumulation, making it a more environmentally friendly choice compared to some other materials.\r\n",
