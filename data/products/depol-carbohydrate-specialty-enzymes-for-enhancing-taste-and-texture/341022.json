    "description": "Promod® 517MDP is a highly active exopeptidase with broad specificity. It can be used to achieve &gt;40% degree of hydrolysis (DH) in casein protein. Enzymatic hydrolysis of casein can be used to hydrolyse casein proteins into smaller peptides increasing its solubility and improving digestibility. The extensively hydrolysed protein increases the potential suitability for use in products for individuals with a cow’s milk allergy.\r\n",
