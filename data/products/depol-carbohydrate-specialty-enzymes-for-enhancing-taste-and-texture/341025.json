    "description": "Promod® 845MDP is a protease particularly suited for the manufacture of EMCs where creamy protein notes are required. The exopeptidases present in this product result in the removal of any bitter peptides. Promod® 845MDP can be used on its own or in combination with Biocatalysts' dairy lipases (Lipomod® products). Promod® 845MDP generates cooked, caramel and nutty flavors with very low bitterness; producing a creamy savory taste in EMC application.",
