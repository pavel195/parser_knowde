    "description": "Biocatalysts Ltd Phenylalaninedehydrogenase 98P is a neonatal screening enzyme used to detect Phenylketonuria (PKU). This sensitive enzyme test is cheaper and more rapid that the traditional Guthrie microbial test. Low cross reactivity also results in lower false positives than the Guthrie and fluorometric methods.\r\n",
