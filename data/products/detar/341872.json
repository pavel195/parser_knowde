    "description": "Perlac CF/Liquid is a newly formulated all-in-one cleaning product. Its composition has been carefully studied in order to create a product that would simultaneously meet the cleaning needs of the food industry and fulfill the ever stricter requirements of the environment sector. To achieve this, we’ve used new raw materials that satisfy both demands. Perlac CF/Liquid is a caustic product with added surfactants and sequestering agents with performance levels that allow it to be used effectively even in limit conditions (e.g. particularly hard water, even above 25 °F; temperature higher than 70°C).",
