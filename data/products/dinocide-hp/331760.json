    "description": "ArborFos™, a 46% phosphite formulation in a completely enclosed micro-infusion system, is a fungicide that inhibits fungal growth through stimulation of the plant’s own natural defense systems. Although its mode of action is not completely understood, researchers indicate it may elicit a type of systemic acquired resistance response. While it imparts no actual phosphorous nutrition, trees tend to develop healthier leaves, roots and stems. ArborFos is for use on conifer, ornamental, forest and certain crop trees for diseases such as sudden oak death (P. ramorum), and has recently shown excellent results in sycamore anthracnose management programs.",
