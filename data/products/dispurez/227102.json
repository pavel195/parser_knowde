    "description": "Bubbling. Itâ€™s a problem which pops up time and time again, particularly in areas subject to low temperature and high humidity levels. Fortunately, under these conditions, Aldirez A provides the ability to create primers that remain remarkably resilient and bubble-free. In addition to its exceptional ability to inhibit CO2 generation, formulators are able to accelerate the cure of PU primers, to improve turnaround efficiency, whilst retaining a workable pot life.",
