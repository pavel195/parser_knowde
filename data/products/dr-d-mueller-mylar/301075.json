    "description": "Hostaphan® RN FI 13011 is a transparent biaxial stretched film made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It characterizes by special physical properties. Hostaphan® RN FI 13011 offers unique construction possibilities because of the excellent balance of its electrical properties in combination with chemical, thermal and physical properties. Furthermore Hostaphan® RN FI 13011 characterizes by excellent resistance against humidity and common solvents. Since Hostaphan® RN FI 13011 does not contain any softeners it does not become brittle while aging under normal conditions.",
