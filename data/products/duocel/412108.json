    "description": "Duocel® Aluminum Foam is a rigid, three-dimensional network of interconnected aluminum ligaments that form cells with open pores. Duocel® Aluminum Foam contains completely solid ligaments (as opposed to hollow ligaments) and its properties are fully customizable, which allows its performance characteristics to be optimized for a broad range of applications. Aluminum is ERG’s most popular Duocel® foam and is commonly used in applications that benefit from a lightweight structure, very high surface area, and from the nature-mimicking morphology of the rigid cellular structure.\r\n",
