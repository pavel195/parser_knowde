    "description": "Dynalene HF-LO is a non-toxic, thermally-efficient, odorless aliphatic hydrocarbon heat transfer fluid. Due to the non-aqueous nature of the fluid, it can be used with water-sensitive chemicals to reduce process hazards. Additionally, its high flash point provides improved safety with regards to transportation and electrical hazards.",
