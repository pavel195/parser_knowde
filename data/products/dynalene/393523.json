    "description": "Dynalene LC-PG (propylene glycol-based) is specially designed for cooling PEM fuel cells, electronics, computers, and other applications requiring low electrical conductivity coolants. It provides efficient heat transfer that prevents your system from overheating while simultaneously acting as an electrical insulator. LC products use a non-ionic corrosion inhibitor package that prevents corrosion and contaminants from degrading your system.",
