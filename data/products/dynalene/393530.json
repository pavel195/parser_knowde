    "description": "Dynalene LO-170 (Low Odor, Low Temperature Heat Transfer Fluid) heat transfer fluid provides nontoxic, thermally effective and affordable alternative to the expensive silicone oils or aromatic hydrocarbons. Dynalene LO-170 also exhibits no odor and high flash point characteristics to accommodate most open bath or closed loop heat transfer systems when used within its recommended temperature range. When operator safety, environmental impact and price are a minimum requirement for your next heat transfer application or retrofit, consider Dynalene LO-170.",
