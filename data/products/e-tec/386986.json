    "description": "E-Tec 527 is a mild water-based formulation designed to provide temporary rust protection for steel surfaces stored indoors. It leaves a dry, invisible film that is unaffected by subsequent operations. Excellent for protecting steel surfaces during the manufacturing process. It has a mild cleaning action and can be used in tumbling or burnishing operations to keep steel surfaces from oxidizing too quickly.",
