    "description": "Duro-Bond Neoprene is an elastomeric sheet lining having good abrasion and chemical resistance. It is available either as a precured lining or as an uncured lining that must be vulcanized with steam or hot air before it can be used. Sheet thicknesses of 60 mils (1.1 mm), 120 mils (2.3 mm), 150 mils (3.4 mm), and 180 mils (4.6 mm) are available.",
