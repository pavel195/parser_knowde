    "description": "Eco-UVE™ is a two-component epoxy with a high solids content and excellent UV resistance. It is one of the primary components of the metallic system and is commonly used to seal quartz and flake applications. Eco-UVE can be used as a stand-alone coating as well. For applications requiring a thicker product, an orange-peel option using fumed silica is available (instructions at the end of the document) (e.g., wall systems).",
