    "description": "ReVue™ SLM is a self-leveling underlayment based on Portland and Aluminate cement that is fortified with latex polymer and can be used to level or smooth most properly prepared substrates. Extended working time (30 minutes) allows for a more consistent finish by eliminating seams or cold joints that may occur when using products with a shorter working time. It leaves a finished surface that is suitable for most floor covering systems and can withstand temporary construction traffic.",
