    "description": "BIO-D Opener, Maintainer utilizes the digestive abilities of naturally occurring bacteria to break up this organic material (food waste, animal and vegetable fats and oils, undissolved soap residue) into smaller water-soluble particles. Regular use establishes an active bacteria population that continuously works to keep this accumulation from occurring. Most drain clogs result from the accumulation of organic materials on the inside of drain surfaces. Adding this product to drains once a week and allowing it to work overnight ensures that drains remain open.",
