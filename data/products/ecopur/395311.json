    "description": "r Lift-EZE OC 500 keeps lift station surfaces free of grease. As waste water levels rise and fall, heavy grease deposits are deposited on lift station walls. It coats the walls and surfaces of the lift station to remove heavy grease accumulations quickly and safely. Our special non-emulsifying formula floats on the surface of the water, so it continues to remove deposits as the water level changes. Our unique formula contains a soybean oil derivative which does not evaporate as fast as other solvents, so it remains on the surface of wastewater longer to penetrate fats, oils, and grease (FOG), dirt and strip them away from the surfaces. This product will not disrupt the natural biological process of bacteria in the lift station.",
