    "description": "Rovene 6023 is an all acrylic emulsion suggested as a polymer modifier for hydraulic cementitious mixtures for repair, basecoats for EIFS, decorative overlays and tile grouts or mortars. Addition of 5 - 15% (d/d Portland cement) improves flexibility, strength and water resistance.\nRovene 6023 in portland cement mixtures results in increased adhesion to most substrates, improved water resistance, increased flexural strength and good resistance to UV light. Rovene 6023 does not contain antifoam. The addition of an effective antifoam is generally required to avoid a high air content in the hydraulic cementitious mixture. Many antifoam products have been found effective at levels of 2.5% wet on wet by mass.",
