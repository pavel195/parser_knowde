    "description": "ModCarb® is formulated from six organic, gluten free grains — oats, amaranth, buckwheat, chia, millet and quinoa. ModCarb® is unique from other grains because it undergoes a unique, mechanical (non-enzymatic) process that shatters the tough cell wall and liberates the highly soluble matrix of nutrients, creating a free-flowing hydrocolloid-like material.",
