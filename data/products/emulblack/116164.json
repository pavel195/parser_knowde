    "description": "Solprene 1205 is a linear random-block styrene-butadiene copolymer with a total content of 25% of styrene, 17.5% is present as a polystyrene block.It has a non-staining antioxidant system; FDA approved for use in food contact applications. Is essentially gel free with a clear color.Solprene 1205 is an excellent modifier for asphalt, formulations of caulks and sealants; it is also an excellent processing aid for most polymers, giving a good resistance to low temperature. Used in extruded goods, soles and heels. It can also be used as modifier for thermoplastic resins and in adhesive formulations.",
