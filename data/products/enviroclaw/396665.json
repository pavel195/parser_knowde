    "description": "Level Sealer™ is a new generation of Post-Catalyzed amino alkyd finishing system that offers the ultimate in durability. It is a HAPS Free high solids, waterwhite formula specifically designed for interior wood surfaces that are exposed to moisture, heat and household chemicals. It was also designed so that you can build the dry mils past the normal 5 mils maximum recommendation. So, if you want to have a full fill or thick build look and you do not want to go to polyurethane, Level Sealer™ is for you. It gives good sag resistance and can be sprayed from 4-10 wet mils on a vertical surface. It can also be built with multiple thin coats to get 10 - 12 dry mils by allowing each coat to dry thoroughly.",
