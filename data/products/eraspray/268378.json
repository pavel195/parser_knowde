    "description": "Erapol CC50A is a cold castable polyurethane 50 Shore A elastomer. The product is free from MOCA (methylene bis-ortho chloroaniline) and flammable solvents that produces an elastomer with outstanding toughness, high elongation and abrasion resistance. It offers advantages in that it can be readily processed and cured at room or elevated temperatures. The convenient mix ratio and low viscosity allow for easy processing.",
