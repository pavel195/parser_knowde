    "description": "BLS 1130 (104810-48-2 & 104810-47-1)is a liquid benzotriazole UV absorber that provides outstanding light stability to industrial and automotive coatings. It blends easily and disperses completely, reducing loading requirements and virtually eliminating particle dispersion problems associated with solid UV absorbers. The liquid form is also highly compatible with a wide variety of coating systems, including waterborne and solvent-based systems. BLS 1130 is also useful as a light stabilizer in other applications including plastics, adhesives, and sealants.",
