    "description": "Benetex OB Plus (7128-64-5)is a heat resistant, solvent soluble, chemically stable fluorescent whitener that provides brighter looking colors. It is used to offset the yellowness of a polymer and to yield a whiter appearance. Optical brighteners create brilliance by absorbing UV light, modifying the wavelength of the light and then emitting the light in a fluorescent fashion. Benetex OB Plus can also be used as a tracer in various applications and as an optical brightener in thermoplastics, coatings, printing inks, dyes, man-made fibers, waxes, fats, and oils. This fine powder form is ideally suited for: 1.) screen printing applications where reduced clogging of equipment is critical to increase productivity and 2.) clear-coat applications where efficiency of dispersion and a smooth coating appearance is needed",
