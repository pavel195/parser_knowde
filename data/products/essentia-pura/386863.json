    "description": "Broad-Spectrum THC Free CBD Distillate is a whole-plant hemp extract with almost all of the THC removed but it still contains terpenes and other minor cannabinoids such as CBG and CBN. The distillate is standardized with 80-90% pure CBD potency. With our validated testing method, we guarantee manufacturers that our THC free distillate is never higher than 0,1% Tetrahydrocannabinol. Actually, it is consistently lower than that and can be considered at THC-free when added to the end product. This way, THC free CBD distillate can be used worldwide in the cosmetic products and food industry, including consumer goods such as CBD tinctures, vaping oils, e-liquids, lotions, CBD balms, gel capsules, topical, patches, creams, and other similar CBD products. It is also used in further refinement and production.",
