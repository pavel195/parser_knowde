    "description": "Essentium PET-CF is a 15% carbon fiber reinforced polyester filament made with Luvocom® 3F resin from Lehvoss. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a semicrystalline polyester commonly used in soda bottles and automotive parts when reinforced with a fiber-filler. This material is one of the easiest filaments in our portfolio to print and has an outstanding price-to-performance ratio. PET-CF has a good balance of stiffness and strength, and when annealed it has temperature resistance of over 155˚C, and good chemical resistance for common solvents.",
