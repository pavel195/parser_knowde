    "description": "Essentium TPU 74D-Z is a high durometer filament in Essentium’s electrostatically dissipative (ESD) portfolio. With non-marring surface properties, you don’t have to worry about latent failures in electronics. Essentium’s Z line of filaments are the only industrially-proven safe materials for ESD sensitive applications. Essentium TPU 74D-Z is a no-warp drop in replacement for ABS. It has excellent impact strength, tear strength, and abrasion resistance.",
