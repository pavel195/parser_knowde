    "description": "Essentium Flame Retardant TPU 90A has been engineered to have the perfect balance of elasticity and toughness. This filament exhibits excellent interlayer adhesion and high strain at break; the base resin is UL94 V0 certified for flame retardancy and printed samples pass FAA FAR 25.853(a) 12 and 60 second vertical flame tests for 1/16” and 1/4” thickness. Our TPU 90A FR filament is perfect for a print that needs inherent flame retardant properties with flexibility, grip, and abrasion resistance. Use this material to make flexible hinges, belts, plugs, gaskets, protective cases, overgrips, wheels, vibration dampeners, energy-absorbing lattices, and so much more.",
