    "description": "Down Under Enterprises International ANISE MYRTLE OIL formerly known as Backhousia anisata and Anetholea anisata, the anethole chemotype of the botanically reassigned Syzygium anisatum can be used as a flavoring agent in foods and beverages. Like many other plants with similar flavor qualities it acts as a digestive aid and carminative. Low amounts will suffice in most formulations as it has a very high odor and flavor intensity.",
