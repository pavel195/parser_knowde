    "description": "Cypress White (Wood) Oil is obtained via steam distillation from the wood of Callitris columellaris. It blends well with citrus or floral notes, but may compete with other oils of strong odor personality.The essential oil is relatively new on the commercial market though its investigation began over a century ago. The timbers are hard and dense and are renowned for their resistance to the Australian termite population (due to the essential oil in the heartwood).",
