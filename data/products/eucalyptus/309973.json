    "description": "Eucalyptus Lemon Scented Oil is used in the perfume industry to manufacture other aroma chemicals, due to its rich citronellal content. Lemon Scented Eucalyptus also acts as a wonderful insect repellent, rivaling DEET in some products. Carroll, et al. reported on a technique to produce para Menthane-3,8 diol (PMD) in large quantities from the essential oil of Eucalyptus citriodora. PMD is endorsed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as effective non-DEET repellent against mosquito species Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, and Ochlerotatus.Psychologically it can be very soothing and calming.",
