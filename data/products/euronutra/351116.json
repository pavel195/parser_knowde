    "description": "euronutra saffron is obtained from picking the bright red or orange ends of the saffron flower pistils, also know as stigmas. It is both a spice and a herb with strong properties in pharmaceutics, cosmetics, perfumery, and textile dye-producing industries. Although it contains both alpha and beta-carotene, two potent natural antioxidants and coloring agents, saffron owes most of its bright red pigment to a particular carotenoid called alpha-crocin. According to several studies, the crocins in saffron protect nerve cells from free radicals damage and promote nerve generation.",
