    "description": "EVERNOX-10 is a sterically hindered phenolic antioxidant with a highly effective, non-discoloring stabilizer for organic materials. It protects these materials against thermo-oxidative degradation. EVERNOX-10 can be applied in polyolefins, such as PE, PP and olefin copolymers like EVA. Also its use is recommended in various polymers such as POM, PA, PUR, PES, PBT, PET, PVC, styrenic like IPS, ABS, elastomers like SBS, SEBS, EPM and EPDM as well as synthetic rubbers, adhesives tackifier and other organic substrates. EVERNOX-10 has good compatibility, high resistance to extraction and low volatility, odorless. It can be used in combination with other additives like costabilizers (e.g. thioesters, phosphites, phosphonites), light stabilizer and other functional stabilizers. The synergistic blends of EVERNOX-10 with EVERFOS-168 are extreme performance in polymers stabilization.",
