    "description": "EVERNOX-2246 is one of the most widely used antioxidants for white, light colored and transparent vulcanates that are based on natural or synthetic rubbers. In light colored vulcanates, it retards the crazing effect caused by exposure to light. It does not influence processing and vulcanizing properties. It exhibits low volatility and migration which makes it suitable for use in POM and ABS. EVERNOX-2246 is listed in Section 175.105 of the Food Additives Regulations as a component food packaging adhesives and in Section 177.2600 as a component of rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food. Total antioxidant is not to exceed 5% by weight of rubber product. It is also permitted for use in olefin polymers per Section 178.2010 at levels not to exceed 0.1 wt. % of the finished product, in contact with foods of high water content, alcoholic beverages, moist and dry solids containing no free fat or oil on the surface, etc.",
