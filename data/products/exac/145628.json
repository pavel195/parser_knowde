    "description": "Rulon® AR is somewhat more flexible than Rulon® LR, hence suitable for seals and bonded coating of slide surfaces. It has many decades of use in automotive shaft seals and fuel metering pump cups.Rulon AR has a practically universal chemical inertness like that of Rulon LR and provides long life and reliability in continuous non-lubricated service. It is capable of operating at PV values up to approximately 10,000. Higher PV values are possible for intermittent use applications.",
