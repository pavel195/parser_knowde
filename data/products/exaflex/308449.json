    "description": "EXAFLEX 6028 is a propylene oxide and ethylene oxide based trifunctional polyol. The calibrated amount of ethylene oxide with high primary end groups gives extra reactivity with isocynates allowing it to be used for one shot HR molded foam using high pressure as well as low pressure machines. The HR molded foam using EXAFLEX 6028 are characterized by high resiliency and good surface properties and good elasticity.",
