    "description": "Exlfilm® HSP is a fast-sealing film that allows for short dwell times that maximize production and increase plant efficiency. Your product is protected from the rigors of high-speed packaging and shipping by consistently strong seals and exceptional tensile strength. The high slip ensures easier material handling, collating and package insertion. HSP gets the job done fast and looks great too, with superior optics and shrinkage.",
