    "description": "Exolon® Multi UV 2/4-8 is a range of heat-insulating multiwall sheets. Their insulating characteristic can be increased, doubled, tripled or quadrupled by the number of ribs. Single surface protection offers the advantage of making the Exolon® multi UV sheets UV and weathering-resistant. Even hail has no impact on this resistant material. The sheets can be cold-bent.",
