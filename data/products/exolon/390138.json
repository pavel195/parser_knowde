    "description": "Exolon® UV ClimateControl is a transparent polycarbonate sheet with a protective UV coating on both sides. The sheets substantially reduce high temperatures caused by sunlight as they block out the majority of infrared light. It is extremely resistant to permanent environmental impacts and has a long service life. The maximum permissible temperature for long-term use in the absence of loads is in the region of 120°C. An additional benefit, is that the sheets come with a 10-year warranty on weather resistance, transparency and breaking strength.",
