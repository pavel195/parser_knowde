    "description": "Exolon® Titan sheets are clear, polished polycarbonate sheets. They offer extreme impact strength that exceeds the physical properties of other products of their class. Exolon® sheets resist temperatures of -100 to +120 °C, exhibit high optical clarity and have a good fire rating. The sheets offer protection against involuntary breakage and wilfull destruction. Exolon® Titan sheets can be thermoformed, cold-curved and machined with ease.",
