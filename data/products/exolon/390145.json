    "description": "Exolon® WS - Welding Shield sheets are polycarbonate sheets which comply with requirements for transparent screens in arc welding processes. They protect against the hazardous radiation emitted during arc welding processes and meet the requirements on light transmission, UV-stability and fire resistance specified in EN ISO 25980: 2014. The sheets are available in different colors. Exolon® WS sheets offer extreme impact strength that exceeds the physical properties of other products of their class. They resist to temperatures of -100 to +120°C.",
