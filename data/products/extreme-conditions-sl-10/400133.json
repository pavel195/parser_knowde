    "description": "Metal Treatment MT-10® Transmission is an anti-friction additive designed to address extreme-pressure areas, such as planetary and worm gear systems, along with bushings, bearings and shafts. It is an industry leader in reducing those costly comebacks because it reduces frictional heat and wear without surface build up.",
