    "description": "Elogio AM ABS Filament is a thermoplastic and a copolymer that is used for rigid objects. It consists of 5-30% Butadiene, around 50% Styrene and the rest is Acrylonitrile. ABS is a strong material with high toughness and impact resistance. The maximum operating temperature is between 85 °C and 100 °C, depending on the modifications. The minimum operating temperature is -35 °C. ABS is a flammable polymer to which flame retardant can be added. It is also subject to aging by being exposed to the weather conditions (UV light, oxygen, moisture, heat) because Polybutadiene stimulates the oxidation of Polystyrene. This causes discolouration and the plastic loses its mechanical strength. In order to improve this UV stabilizers can be added.",
