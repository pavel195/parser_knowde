    "description": "Luvocom® 3F PAHT 9825 NT Filament is a unreinforced High-temperature polyamide. Its water uptake takes about 4 times longer to reach the saturation point compared to unmodified PA6, also its saturation point is 5 times lower than conventional PA6 materials. This particular engineering polymer grade is tailored made for the 3D printing industry to match the injection molding strength requirements and focusing on the serial production of end-parts. The filament can be used on conventional FFF / FDM 3D printing systems due to the enhanced printability, improved layer bonding and the unrequired use of a heated chamber.",
