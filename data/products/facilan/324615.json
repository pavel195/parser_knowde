    "description": "Luvocom® 3F PPS CF 9938 BK Filament is a Polyphenylene sulfide, linear with 15% added carbon fibers, and is known for it's heat and chemical resistance. Below 200 °C the material doesn't dissolve in any solvent. This particular high performance polymer grade is tailored made for the 3D printing industry to match the injection molding strength requirements and focusing on the serial production of end-parts. The filament can be used on conventional FFF / FDM 3D printing systems due to the enhanced printability, improved layer bonding and the unrequired use of a heated chamber.",
