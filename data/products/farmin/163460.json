    "description": "LEVENOL速 F-200 is part of a new generation of readily biodegradable non-ionic surfactants of vegetable origin with a low eco-toxicological profile that can be used in detergent compositions and household products. The relative medium foaming power of LEVENOL速 F-200 allows for reduced content of foam controllers in the final detergent and the performance (detergent power) of LEVENOL速 F-200 in most formulations can be considered similar or even better than standard non-ionic surfactants. This product can be used as an emulsifier, extracts and fragrances solubilizer, or as a detergent.",
