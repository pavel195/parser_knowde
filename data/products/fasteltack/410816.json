    "description": "FastelMask RT500 was created as a protective mask that easily removes from a variety of surfaces while leaving no adhesive residue. RT500 is made up of an electrical grade polyester substrate that has been coated with a silicone adhesive. When exposed to high temperatures, the polyester backing virtually eliminates shrinkage. Once applied to your substrate, the RT500 protects your substrate or device from surface damage during fabrication, installation, handling, and shipping.",
