    "description": "GS15-4® is commercially available in bulk and in 165 mg vegetarian capsules (serving size is one capsule). Ginseng Extract is produced through a fermentation process that transforms the ginsenosides into these end-stage metabolites, mimicking the fermentation environment of the colon. This transformation has been clinically proven to provide 15 times increased absorption, 4 times faster absorption and 4 times more consistent absorption—with a better taste profile than conventional ginseng extracts.",
