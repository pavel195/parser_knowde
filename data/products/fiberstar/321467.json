    "description": "GlucoStar® C500F-HV is a coldwater soluble, high viscosity, anionic polymer for use in industrial applications. It is a substituted natural polysaccharide designed to impart enhanced functional properties including: solution stability, surface activity, water retention, improved rheology and viscosity. GlucoStar C500F-HV also offers a unique alternative to competitive natural and synthetic water-soluble polymers. GlucoStar C500F-HV is specifically designed for use as a viscosifier in vat dyestuffs for textile flat goods printing applications. In addition, the ultra-low level of insoluble particles and high viscosity of GlucoStar C500F-HV makes it a good thickener for screen-printing",
