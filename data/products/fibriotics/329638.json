    "description": "FBG22™ is black garlic obtained from fresh garlic (Allium sativum L.) which has been triple fermented for a certain period. It is a technological process that takes months. It is carried out under controlled humidity at various pre-programmed temperatures. Certain substances disappear, such as certain aromatic substances, but other substances are produced. This strengthens the medicinal properties of the plant and softens the odor. The color becomes dark brown due to the reaction of Maillard. FBG22™ is a good source of vitamins &amp; minerals, amino acids, antioxidants, polyphenols and flavonoids.",
