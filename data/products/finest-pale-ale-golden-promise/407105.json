    "description": "Simpsons Malt Extra Pale Ale Malt ASBC is Traditional but light, high extract British base malt. Extra Pale Ale Malt is an excellent base malt for Brewers who require a low color, well modified malt. The plump grains of UK two-row barley ensure uniformity and consistency, as well as good extract and enzymic activity. Extra Pale Ale Malt doubles as a great light-colored base for both Lagers and Ales.",
