    "description": "Respin RLP is a flaked thermoplastic natural resin used in solvent-based coating formulations for the foundry industry. This plant-based raw material is obtained from a native Brazillian tree of the pine family, the Parana Pine. Our product has physical and chemical properties similar to the Indian resin Shellac, thus placing Respin RLP in the favored position of cost-effective substitute or compatible extender for Shellac in formulations for foundry coatings.",
