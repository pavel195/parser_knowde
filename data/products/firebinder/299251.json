    "description": "Respin Shellac Matte is a natural resin capable of awarding wooden surfaces a matte finish when added to wood varnish formulations. This plant-based product is obtained from a native Brazillian tree, known as the Parana Pine. Respin Shellac Matte is soluble in esters, acetone, ethanol and methanol, while being insoluble in aliphatic solvents, water and aromatic solvents. Furthermore, for added flexibility, this natural resin can be used by itself or with other raw materials in wood varnish formulations.",
