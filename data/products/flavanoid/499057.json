    "description": "Fruit Derivatives Comminute Aseptic is a product composed of fruit (90%â€“100%) and optionally water (up to 10%), with citric acid also being optional for pH adjustment. It is guaranteed to be free from any signs of rot, blemishes, or foreign matter. The fruit undergoes a thorough washing and inspection process before entering production. The color of the product is typical and characteristic of the named fruit, and both the odor and taste maintain the typical and characteristic attributes of the fruit. In terms of appearance, the puree texture is designed to be viscous yet easy to handle, free from clumping. This versatile product is suitable for use in foodstuffs and is particularly valuable in the food industry for secondary processing.\r\n",
