    "description": "SYNTRAN速 5900 is a water-based emulsion that modifies the visual appearance of personal care products from clear to opaque without affecting the other desired properties of the formula.\n\nSYNTRAN速 opacifiers give whiteness and density at significant low levels (from 0.1 to 1.0 percent as supplied) with excellent formulation stability.\n\nSYNTRAN速 5900 is slowly added to the base product under agitation at the end of the manufacturing cycle (i.e., after final adjustment). A stability control is recommended.",
