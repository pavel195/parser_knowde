    "description": "ArmorPrime (726) is a straw/clear 100% solids two component epoxy specifically formulated to be used as both a primer and/ or a base coat. Due to the low viscosity of this product, it is an ideal choice to adhere to concrete creating a tenacious bond. This product can be applied as a “neat” coat, or can be mixed with aggregates such as fine mixed silica to aid in filling in rough or uneven substrates. ArmorPrime #726 has been designed for interior use only.",
