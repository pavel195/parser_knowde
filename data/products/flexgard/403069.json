    "description": "ArmorPrime Ultra-Fast (727) is a straw/clear 100% solids two component epoxy specifically formulated to be used as both a primer and/or a base coat. ARMORPRIME ULTRA-FAST has been specifically formulated to cure very rapidly. Due to the low viscosity of this product, it is an ideal choice to adhere to concrete creating a tenacious bond. This product can be applied as a “neat” coat, or can be mixed with aggregates such as fine mixed silica to aid in filling in rough or uneven substrates. ArmorPrime Ultra-Fast #727 has been designed for interior use only.",
