    "description": "FlexGard M (739) is a unique 100% solids, two-component, low modulus flexible epoxy coating system. This self-leveling, flexible membrane produces elongation characteristics of 150% to 160% and remains flexible at temperatures between 0°F and 150°F. A resilient, durable, and tough flexible surface that is excellent for bridging non-working or nonmoving cracks up to 1/16\" wide without additional preparation or the need to address each crack individually.",
