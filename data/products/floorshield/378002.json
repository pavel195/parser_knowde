    "description": "ECP 9906 is Conductive Glass Fiber Filled Polyphenylene Sulfide Carbon Nanotube Compound Injection Molding proprietary TBA ECP injection molding compound utilizing multi wall carbon nanotube technology to give a permanently conductive material. Special compounding techniques at low filler loadings ensure the retention of physical properties and excellent cleanliness. ECP 9906 is a very high performance thermoplastic with a very high modulus and strength plus a very high continuous service temperature (240°C, short term exposure up to 270°C). It is inherently flame retardant (UL 94 V0), has very good chemical and oxidation resistance, very low water absorption and very low creep, even at elevated temperatures.",
