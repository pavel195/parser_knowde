They are also very effective in the period when uptake of nutrients by the plant’s root system is limited (drought, inappropriate pH). Cobalt chelate is designed for foliar nutrition of plants. Cobalt is a component of vitamin B12 and is indispensable in the process of nitrogen bonding in the plant.",
