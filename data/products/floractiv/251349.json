    "description": "The L-Actipol EDTA Zn-6 chelate quickly and effectively responds to the plants’ actual needs. It is also very effec-tive in the period when uptake of zinc by the plant’s root system is limited (drought, inappropriate pH, low tem-peratures). Zinc chelate is designed for extra-root nutrition of plants and fertigation. It covers increased demand for zinc, especially by corn, spring and winter cereals, root plants and fruit trees and bushes.",
