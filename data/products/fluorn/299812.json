    "description": "FluorN-S83 is an additive used to reduce the surface tension of solvent-based paints and to make them hydrophobic and oleophobic. S83 also improves leveling properties, ice and snow repellency of dried films. In some applications S83 reduces craters, pinholes, and orange peel in solvent-based paints. FluorN-S83 is typically used at 5% weight of the solvent-based paint.",
