    "description": "FluorAcryl 7298 is a perfluoropolyether (PFPE) used as an additive in other UV curable coatings to reduce surface tension and improve water, oil and stain resistance. Films and coatings with 7298 may be expected to provide anti-fouling and easy cleaning from fingerprints and other contaminants. FluorAcryl 7298 is compatible with many monomers, such as TMPTA. With or without pigments and other particulates, 7298 rapidly UV cures in the presence or absence of oxygen.",
