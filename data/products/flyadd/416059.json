    "description": "Flytac 120 - 90W is a granular, water-white, modified gum rosin polyols esters made from specially refined gum rosin using a series of advanced processes of partial hydrogenation, esterification, and stabilization. They are a new generation of natural tackifier resins that exhibit good aging resistance, and excellent compatibility. Also capable of raising the initial and persistent viscosity of pressure-sensitive adhesive in a simultaneous way, the excellent heat stability increases by less than 1 degree of Gardner Color within consecutive 8 hours at 180Â°C.",
