    "description": "Dragonsorb® 320 is a highly effective light stabilizer that features strong UV absorption, low volatility, and excellent compatibility with a variety of substrates. It protects polymers as well as organic pigments from UV radiation, which helps preserve the original appearance and physical integrity of molded articles, films, sheets, and fibers during outdoor weathering. This product is slightly more discoloring than conventional UV absorbers. It can be used for a variety of plastics and other organic substrates, including unsaturated polyesters, PVC, and PVC plastisol. Additionally, good results are expected when this product is used in polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polyamides, and synthetic fibers, particularly those with a polyester, epoxy, or isocyanate resin base.",
