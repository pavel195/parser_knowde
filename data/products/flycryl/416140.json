    "description": "Dragonox® 1135 is an excellent antioxidant that may be used in a variety of polymers. Because of its low volatility and excellent compatibility, it is particularly well suited for use in forced air cooling processes for PU. This product is used in the stabilization of PV flexible slabstock foams to prevent the formation of peroxides in the polyol during storage and transport and to further protect against scorching during foaming. It also helps prevent fogging in automotive applications, and the low volatility of this product makes it a perfect fit where meat liquids, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, or melts are an integral part of polymer manufacturing and processing. This product has the convenience of a pumpable liquid that can be added before, during, or after polymerization.",
