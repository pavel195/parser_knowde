    "description": "GacoFlex® LM60 is a 100% solids liquid applied two-component coating that cures into a water-resistant polyurethane elastomeric membrane. LM60H is designed for application on horizontal and low slope surfaces, at the rate of at least four gallons per 100 ft², to yield a 1/16\" thick membrane. LM60V is designed for the same application rate and the yield on vertical surfaces.",
