    "description": "GEHR PC® is a transparent material and belongs to the group of amorphous engineering plastics as well as to the polyester family of plastics. It has a high stiffness and extremely high impact strength. It also has a high glass transition temperature and heat deflection temperature (approx. +130 °C). The continuous operating temperature of PC ranges between approximately -60 °C and +120 °C. The material is highly resistant to high-energy radiation. However, it must be stabilized against UV rays, otherwise yellowing may occur. Like all polyesters, PC is not resistant to hot water (from approx. +60 °C) in the long term.",
