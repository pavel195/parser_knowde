    "description": "GEHR PPS® is continuous operating temperature of this high-performance plastic is approximately +230 °C. It has very high mechanical performance combined with excellent thermal and chemical resistance as well as high dimensional stability and creep resistance. The LOI of this material is among the highest among polymers. The excellent hardness and stiffness are further characteristics of PPS. It closes the gap between semi-crystalline, engineering plastics and PEEK through its strength and economic efficiency.",
