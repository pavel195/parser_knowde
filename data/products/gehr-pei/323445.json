    "description": "GEHR PPS® 40 GF is a variant of PPS modified with 40 % glass fibers. Due to the high glass fiber content, strength ranges comparable to light metals can be achieved. This material owes its significantly increased dimensional stability to its very low coefficient of linear expansion.",
