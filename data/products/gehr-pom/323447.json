    "description": "GEHR PPSU® is an amorphous material, with improved impact and hydrolysis resistance compared to PSU. This amber-colored, transparent material is usually used in a black color, which is why we only offer it in this color version so far. The usual operating temperature is approx. +170 °C. The extremely high notch impact strength remains also after a heat aging.",
