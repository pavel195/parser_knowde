    "description": "GEHR POM® ELS is a variant of POM-C with enhanced electrical conductivity. The conductivity is generated by a specially adjusted additive. Migration to the part surface, and thus strong fluctuation of the good conductivity, should therefore not occur. The surface resistance, measured on the semi-finished product, is ≤104 Ω.",
