    "description": "Teflon® ETFE, also known as Ethylene TetraFluoroEthylene, is a thermoplastic copolymer formed by the polymerization of ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene (TEFLON®) monomers. This resin is a tough, abrasion-resistant material with excellent chemical resistance and continuous operating temperatures of up to 150 C/300°F. ETFE is also a good electrical insulator with nonstick and low friction properties.",
