    "description": "ELASTOSIL® Color Paste PT Black RAL 9011 F is a ready-to-use masterbatch comprising specific pigments and reactive silicone polymers that are commonly used to produce ELASTOSIL® high-consistency silicone rubber. This ensures a homogeneous covulcanization of the color paste without significant impairment of the physical properties (e.g. hardness) and without migration, as may be observed for systems based on silicone oil.",
