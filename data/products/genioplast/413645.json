    "description": "ELASTOSIL速 LR 3675/50 A/B is a self-adhesive liquid silicone rubber of the ELASTOSIL速 LR 3675 series. It is a paste-like, easily pigmentable, two-component compound with a short curing time and a low coefficient of friction. In comparison with ELASTOSIL速 LR 3070 grades, the coefficient of friction is reduced by 50-70%. The vulcanizates are noted for their excellent mechanical and electrical properties. Due to the low compression set, there is no need to post-cure finished parts.",
