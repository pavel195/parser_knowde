    "description": "WACKER® AK 1000 is a linear, non-reactive polydimethylsiloxane with a viscosity of approximately 1000 mm²/s. Its chemical structure gives it an exceptional property profile that distinguishes it from organic materials like mineral oils. It exhibits low surface tension, resulting in high surface activity. Additionally, it is chemically highly unreactive and has a low solidifying point.",
