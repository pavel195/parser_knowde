    "description": "Plus® ML topcoats are lubricated sealers specially engineered for application over Geomet® basecoats. These topcoats provide controlled friction coefficient of threaded parts and increase the resistance to corrosion. The controlled sacrificial corrosion protection mechanism of Geomet® basecoats is further improved with the addition of Plus® topcoats.",
