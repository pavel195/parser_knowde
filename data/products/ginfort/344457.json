    "description": "Curcugen® CQN-98-CG appears as an orange-red powder. It is a water-dispersible extract derived from whole turmeric and stands out for delivering a significantly higher concentration of curcuminoids to the bloodstream compared to purified curcuminoids 95% (C-95%) extracts. This formulation is distinctive for its lack of synthetic or non-turmeric bio-enhancers, making it more palatable for food and beverage applications.",
