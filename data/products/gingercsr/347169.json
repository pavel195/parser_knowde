    "description": "ResveratrolEBA™ micro-encapsulates a standardized extract of the Giant Knotweed plant with 95% of Resveratrol (extracts from other botanical and herbal sources are also commercially available). As the natural bioavailability of Resveratrol is extremely low, ResveratrolEBA™ includes a proprietary bioavailability-enhancing formulation for Resveratrol, that enhances both the water-solubility and the resulting systemic absorption of Resveratrol.",
