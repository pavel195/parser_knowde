    "description": "Glass Gleam-3™ Glass Cleaner Super Concentrate uses a formulation designed specifically for professional window cleaners. Mix just 1/10th of an ounce per gallon of water. Tests with the leading window cleaning companies and a survey of window cleaners who switched to GG-3 show conclusively that Glass Gleam-3™ is the product window cleaners prefer over most other brands. Unlike dish soaps, GG-3 leaves no residue, won’t foam up on you, stays wetter on hot and windy days and won’t leave white marks when dry.",
