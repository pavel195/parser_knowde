    "description": "Oil-Flo 141™ Specialty Adhesive Remover dissolves hard-to-clean residues, organic stains, and substances. This amazing cleaner will quickly remove adhesives of any type – including mastic, multipurpose, baseboard, parquet, latex, and all asphalt types. Also dissolves grease, oil, waxes, creosote, resin, chewing gum, crayons, tree pitch, tire marks, lipstick, and other difficult materials. Oil-Flo 141™ is less aggressive than our original Oil-Flo™ Safety Solvent Cleaner and has a pleasant fragrance. Typically used for indoor applications. Bonds to the stain and emulsifies it, then bonds to the oxygen molecules present in water. This two-step process allows a final cleanup with a rinse with plain water.",
