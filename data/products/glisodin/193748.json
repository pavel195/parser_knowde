    "description": "Xanthigen速 supports healthy body weight through the synergistic effects of the natural compounds found in Brown Seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida) and Pomegranate Seed Oil. Separately, the bioactive compounds in these two ingredients target pathways involved in body weight regulation including adipocyte differentiation, resting energy expenditure and lipid metabolism. Combined in Xanthigen速 they support weight loss as demonstrated in a recent clinical trial. This study involved a total of 151 obese, non-diabetic females and showed significant weight loss by those taking Xanthigen速 versus those taking placebo over the course of the16 weeks trial.",
