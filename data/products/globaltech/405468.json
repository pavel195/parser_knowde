    "description": "GlobalTech® Lead-Free Paste Remover (LFPR) is a safe, low cost cleaner for high tack and difficult to clean lead-free solder pastes, water soluble lead-free pastes and fluxes. It is also effective in removing all types of solder pastes, even those containing other metals, and fluxes. It works quickly to remove tough organic contaminants such as soldering oils, waxes, silicones, uncured adhesives and other similar soils found in electronic assembly manufacturing. LFPR dries at the right speed to enable complete cleaning without slowing down production. It can be used as a general degreaser.",
