    "description": "T-Det® A 1340-7 is an APE-free, 70% active polymeric surfactant designed for use in emulsion polymerization systems. It can be used as the primary emulsifier or with co-surfactants and has a unique reaction profile with low levels of polyethylene glycol. This product provides stability against viscosity creep, shear thickening, and freeze-thaw separation when post-added to acrylic latex. It is useful for both acrylic and styrene-acrylic latex.",
