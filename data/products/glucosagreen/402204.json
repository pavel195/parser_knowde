    "description": "GlucosaGreen® Glucosamine sulfate 2KCl is bio-equivalent to glucosamine that was formerly produced from shellfish or the fungus aspergillus niger. It provides the same efficacy as traditional glucosamine, but is more consistent with demands of today’s consumers who want plant-based, sustainably produced products. Manufactured, processed, and sold exclusively through TSI Group Bio-Active Ingredients Division, it is available as a tablet grade, capsule grade, soft chew grade, or to a custom spec. It is also available as glucosamine sulfate sodium.",
