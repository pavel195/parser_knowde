    "description": "CaloriBurnGP™ has been shown to effectively activate BAT (Brown Adipose Tissue), which is a very unique type of fat cell that is both thermogenic and metabolically active, burning calories rather than storing them like typical White Adipose Tissue (WAT). BAT is increasingly recognized as a powerful metabolic target, playing a significant role in the regulation of body composition and energy expenditure.",
