    "description": "NucleoPrime™ is a premium, clinically researched blend of nucleotides, which are complex molecules that form DNA and RNA, act as signaling molecules and metabolic co-factors, and form the body’s energy-rich molecules, namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\nAlthough it can make nucleotides, the body’s requirements increase markedly during growth and stress—such as exercise—and in these situations, supplementation with dietary nucleotides may provide tremendous metabolic, immunological and physiological advantages. Research has shown that supplementation with nucleotides may be beneficial for exercise performance and recovery.",
