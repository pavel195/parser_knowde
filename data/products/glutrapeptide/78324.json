    "description": "Nanospheres 100® Ascorbic Acid are very small matricial particles made from a porous polymer. This special structure gives them good adsorption properties. Nanospheres 100® Acide Ascorbique (NCK) are \"bioadhesive\" particles whose affinity for proteins is obtained thanks to a functionalization of the particle by alkyl thiosulfates. It is ideal for use in any cosmetic product with an anti-free radical activity, such as anti-aging and sun products.",
