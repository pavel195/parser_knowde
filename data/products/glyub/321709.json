    "description": "Glylub 23 is to design particularly for high temperature performance. They improve thermal resistance and volatility offering high viscosity, flash point and extremely low vapor pressure. It is also obtained fr om trimellitic anhydride and linear or branched alcohol. They retain the principal characteristics of phthalate additives but improving thermal properties.",
