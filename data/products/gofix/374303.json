    "description": "Gofix® FQ 900 is a two-component putty based on styrene-free polyester resin. It is fast healing. Taking into account the characteristics of the support and the force to which the fixation will be subjected, chemical fixation of elements cannot be done by the traditional way. It can be used in hollow or compact materials: concrete, cement, natural stone, stone, masonry, etc. It allows strong fixing of supports, joining of concrete reinforcement bars, consolidation of sections and profiled bars.",
