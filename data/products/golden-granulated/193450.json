    "description": "Standardized inverts made from pure cane sugar by a process that converts sucrose into a combination of fructose and dextrose sugars, resulting in a characteristically unique sweetener system. These sugars have significantly different characteristics than sucrose, corn syrup combinations, or other sugars, and offer a lighter flavor, increased moisture retention in fresh baked goods, improved crust color, solubility, and enhanced shelf life. FreshVert® Liquid and Nulomoline® #7 are liquid forms, FreshVert® Creamy and Nulomoline® Congealed are high-solids forms, and Nulomoline® #11 is a partial-invert liquid form.",
