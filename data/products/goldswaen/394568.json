    "description": "SWAEN® WHEAT DARK is richer in flavor with a flimsy, more sparkling beer with a typical ale aroma. Perfect for making wheat beers but also used in barley malt-based beers. Gives the beer fuller body and head stability. Cured at 100 to 110 °C. Dark wheat malt is used predominantly for dark wheat beers, alt beers, and dark low alcohol beers. Best pick for outstanding wheat &amp; other special beers.",
