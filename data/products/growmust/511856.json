    "description": "Cossil® 408 conditioning agent offers excellent conditioning for damaged hair. It is an amino (AB)n multiblock copolymer silicone emulsion without surfactants, striking the ideal hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance. Compared to standard amino silicones, it typically provides superior performance at similar active levels due to its more effective deposition onto damaged hair. This versatile agent is suitable for use in shampoos (clear and opaque), rinse-off conditioners, aqueous leave-on products, hair coloring products, and products designed for damaged hair. It aids in promoting fiber-fiber alignment and enhances deposition on damaged hair.",
