    "description": "T-Det® A 1058 is a highly effective, 100% active, alkoxylated surfactant that produces minimal foam and has excellent wetting power. It is effective in rinse aid and bottle wash formulations and can be used in mechanical dishwashing applications. It performs well in cold storage environments due to its low set point. This product is water dispersible, with solubilization possible in formulations using an appropriate hydrotrope. The low foam profile can be further improved by adding small amounts of T-Det® 1618DI302.",
