    "description": "<p>SensaFoam™ F 40 is a liquid-form product suitable for personal care, beauty, and HI&amp;I applications. It offers benefits such as cold processability, foam stability, and improved viscosity. As a secondary surfactant, it mitigates the irritancy of primary anionic surfactants without compromising on detergency, producing formulations that are milder to the skin. Also works well as a primary surfactant in very mild, sulfate-free formulations for babies and adults with sensitive skins and scalps. It is free of preservatives to fit the growing class of \"preservative-free\" cleansers.</p><ul><li><strong>MOQ:</strong> 2,000 kg</li><li><strong>Lead Time:</strong> 2-3 weeks</li></ul><p><br></p>",
