    "description": "HALOX® CW-291 is a white, non-refractive, corrosion-inhibiting pigment used in protective coating systems. It is not recommended for use in immersion or semi-immersion environments. HALOX® CW-291 has the lowest oil absorption of all our borosilicate products and is recommended for use in protective coating systems based on alkyd technology. Because of its low oil absorption, HALOX® CW-291 is specifically suggested for use in high-solids, medium-gloss topcoats, DTM (direct-to-metal) finishes, and self-priming systems. HALOX® CW-291 is compliant with ASTM D 4288-83, specification for calcium borosilicate pigment type 1, class B.",
