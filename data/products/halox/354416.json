    "description": "HALOX速 CW-314 is a heavy metal-free, non-toxic, anti-corrosive pigment designed for use in waterborne and solvent-borne protective coating systems. It is particularly suitable for systems where 21 CFR 175.300 approval or compliance with ANSI or NSF standards is required. HALOX速 CW-314 is highly effective in improving the infrared (IR) reflectance and thermal emissivity of elastomeric roof coatings. It enhances the total solar reflectance (TSR) while maintaining dirt pick-up resistance (DPUR) and preventing mildew growth. It can be used alone or in combination with other non-toxic corrosion inhibitors and mineral pigments in the formulation of environmentally friendly specialty paints.",
