    "description": "HALOX® RC-980 is an organic additive designed to convert red rust to black iron oxide. It can be used in slightly acidic waterborne vinyl or PVDC binders applied to rusted steel substrates. It converts the rust within minutes of the coating application and forms a black iron oxide barrier that can be further top-coated with water or solvent-based paints. It does not contain tannic acid, oxime chelates, phosphates, or phosphoric acid.",
