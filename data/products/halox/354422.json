    "description": "HALOX速 SZP-391 is a white, nonrefractive, corrosion-inhibiting pigment that is highly efficient and versatile. It is recommended for use in a wide variety of resin systems, such as alkyds (both traditional and high solids), epoxies, latexes, water-reducible alkyds, high acid value resins, catalyzed baking systems, and vinylidene chloride latexes. Its fine particle size and low oil absorption make HALOX速 SZP-391 the preferred pigment for thin-film applications (&lt;1 mil or 25 microns).",
