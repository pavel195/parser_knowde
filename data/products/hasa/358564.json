    "description": "Hernon HASA速 722 is a single-component, anaerobic, structural adhesive designed for bonding rigid assemblies. HASA速 722 cure is accomplished when mating surfaces including metal, glass and ceramics are joined together. Accelerated cures are possible with the application of primers or by a short, low temperature heat cycle. Upon cure, HASA速 722 is a highly crosslinked thermoset plastic with excellent properties over a wide range of conditions.",
