    "description": "Bio-Mold Away™ is a colloidal product that encapsulates and removes visible areas of mold including the roots that can penetrate beneath the surface. It attacks the mold in the moisture prone areas to wash off potentially hazardous mold spores and the odor that goes with them. This highly concentrated cleaning solution can be used at dilution as strong as 10:1 or as gentle as 50:1. Depending on your needs one gallon of concentrate will make from 10 to 50 gallons of usable product.\r\n",
