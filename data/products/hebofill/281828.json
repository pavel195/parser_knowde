    "description": "HeBoCoat ® SL-E 125* is a boron nitride spray supplied in an easy-to-use aerosol can. The use of an ethanol base ensures good surface wetting of the coated substrate as well as quick drying. The inorganic binders ensure very good adhesion to metals, glass, ceramics and graphite, especially at high temperatures. The proportion of fine boron nitride particles endow the resultant coating with good release and lubricating properties. HeBoCoat® SL-E 125 is a Boron Nitride spray supplied in a practical aerosol can. Its ethanol base enables good substrate wetting and quick drying. The high temperature adhesive properties of the coating to metallic substrates, glass, ceramics and graphite are excellent.",
