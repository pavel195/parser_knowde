    "description": "Perdure UPr (Perdure Universal Primer) is one component, moisture-cured polyurethane primer. Perdure UPr has excellent adhesion to sound, lightly adhered rusty steel, other marginal or poorly prepared metal surfaces and properly prepared concrete. Perdure UPr undergoes a rapid molecular weight change as it polymerizes into a high molecular weight primer with excellent corrosion, abrasion and high-temperature resistance.",
