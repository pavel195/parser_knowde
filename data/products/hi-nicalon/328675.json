    "description": "Hi-Nicalon™ SiC Fiber is a multi-filament silicon carbide-type fiber manufactured by NGS Advanced Fibers Co., Ltd. (NGS) of Japan. NGS is known worldwide as the leading manufacturer and innovator of multifilament silicon carbide-type fibers. HINICALON™ is manufactured near-oxygen-free using electron-beam curing. The fiber is homogeneously composed of ultra-fine beta-SiC crystallites and carbon. The fiber has excellent strength and modulus properties, and has higher thermal stability than NICALON™.",
