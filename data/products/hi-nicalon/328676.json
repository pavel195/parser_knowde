    "description": "Hi-Nicalon™ Type S SiC Fiber is a multifilament silicon carbide-type fiber manufactured by NGS Advanced Fibers Co., Ltd. (NGS) of Japan. NGS is known worldwide as the leading manufacturer and innovator of multi-filament silicon carbide-type fibers. HI-NICALON™ TYPE S is a stoichiometric beta-SiCfiber manufactured near-oxygen-free using decarbonization pyrolysis and electron-beam curing. It has higher modulus, creep resistance and oxidationresistance than Hi-NICALON™.HI-NICALON™ TYPE S is highly resistant to oxidation and chemical attack and is available in a variety of product forms, depending on the intended use.",
