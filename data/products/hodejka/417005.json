    "description": "Corodur® PR 02 is underlay one-component polyurethane paint with iron mica content designed to create an intermediate layer between the basic anti-corrosion paint (eg Corodur) and the top enamel. The primer must be dry and clean before applying the substrate. The formed paint film creates an effective barrier against the penetration of aggressive components of the atmosphere. Cures with air humidity. The paint is combined with top coats (enamels) and anti-corrosion primers. In the coating system, a suitable composition is designed especially for heavy corrosion exposure.",
