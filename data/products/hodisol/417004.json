    "description": "Corodur® ZR 01 is basic one-component polyurethane paint with zinc content intended for application on steel, cast iron surfaces and light metals or surfaces with the original already degraded coating system. It can also be used on partially corroded surfaces. Thanks to the zinc content, it actively suppresses the formation or course of corrosion and creates a barrier against aggressive components of the atmosphere. Cures with air humidity. The color is combined with the top colors (emails). It is best to repaint it with a subsequent layer within 48 hours. In the coating system of a suitable composition, it is designed for both normal outdoor environments and heavy corrosion exposure.",
