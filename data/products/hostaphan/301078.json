    "description": "Melinex® 238 FI 13020 is a flexible, white polyester film with a matt surface. Melinex® 238 FI 13020 has a relevant according to UL classification\nTemperature index of 140 ° C a mechanical RTI of 130 ° C and has a excellent aging behavior compared to standard polyester films, which have a higher oligomer content. Furthermore, Melinex® 238 FI 13020 high dielectric strength, little change in dielectric values, special mechanical properties and very good hydrolytic stability determined. The half-life of the mechanical properties is comparative doubled.",
