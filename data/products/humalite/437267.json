    "description": "Humalite GG 16 is an organic, fine-grade humic granule, containing 64% humic acid (HPTA method). The fine-grade particle size allows for increased surface area which allows the particles to degrade quickly and creates greater nutrient availability to the plant. Ideal for broadcast or in-furrow application, Humalite GG 16 enables users to apply material directly to the soil or mix with a substrate. Humalite GG 16 has limited blending capabilities.",
