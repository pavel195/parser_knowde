    "description": "CREASPERSE® UV-products are ready-to-use predispersed mineral UV-filters. They are compositions of nanofine Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide or Iron Oxide dispersed in photostable lipids. Creasperse® UVs have maximum concentrations of solids, hence it is easy to obtain high SPFs. Creasperse® UVs offer reliable and consistent UV- protection. The UV-pigments are dispersed in such way, that they distribute evenly and offer maximum capacity of UV-screening. Creasperse® TiO2 dispersions are very photostable and available in different crystal sizes for different kinds of applications. This variety of crystal sizes along with the choice of Zinc Oxide and Iron Oxide brings flexibility to formulating. Standard grades of Creasperse® UV-dispersions are based on Hydrogenated Polydecene and Vegetable Squalane. Creasperse® TR 14 AF 50 has a crystal size of 14 nm, a TiO2 UV-Filter and provides high SPF and low UVA protection. Its vehicle is hydrogenated polydecene and is used in transparent formulations.",
