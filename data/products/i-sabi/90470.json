    "description": "BioCell Collagen® CG is a cosmetic-grade, hydrolyzed chicken sternal cartilage extract. It is composed of a complex matrix of primarily collagen type II peptides, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Collagen, CS, and HA are essential structural components in the skin dermis and are responsible for the skin's moisture, suppleness, elasticity, and beauty. Collagen may slow the degradation of these molecules as we age. It can slow the disarray or collapse of the dermal matrix structure, reducing dermal dehydration and aging skin appearances such as fine lines, wrinkles, and superficial sagging.",
