    "description": "Imagitint AVF HS White are universal type and are designed to have a broad compatibility with water based emulsion paints &amp; solvent containing architectural alkyd enamel paints. These Colorants are VOC &amp; APE free. IMAGITINT AVF Machine Colorants are specifically formulated for the use in volumetric dispensing machines and for volumetric in-plant tinting. IMAGITINT AVF Machine Colorants are suited for accurate and easy dispensing via automated and manual dispensing machines. IMAGITINT AVF Machine Colorants are rigidly controlled for color strength, tone and disperse easily and completely in most decorative paint bases. However, compatibility should be re-ascertained after any change in paint base formulation. IMAGITINT AVF Machine Colorants remain in suspension with minimum agitation and do not skin. Canisters should be properly capped after every top up / addition.",
