    "description": "NIAGEN® NR is a next-generation vitamin B3 that has been found to be naturally-occurring in milk in trace amounts.1 The metabolism of NR is unique from that of other more commonly known forms of vitamin B3, nicotinamide and nicotinic acid. Specifically, NR has been shown in a pre-clinical study to be the most effective form of vitamin B3, increasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) more than nicotinic acid and stimulating NAD+-consuming activities better than nicotinamide.2.",
