    "description": "KEP® 070P produced by Kumho Polychem is a highly functional special synthetic rubber that is mainly used for automotive parts and has excellent resistance to heat, ozone, and chemicals. With a lower specific gravity compared with other synthetic rubbers, it can be applicable for high-filling mixing, meaning it has a high economic feasibility.",
