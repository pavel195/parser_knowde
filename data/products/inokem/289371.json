    "description": "Inokem® 1105 is an APEO free anionic emulsion of alkyd resin for low VOC interior and exterior applications. Thanks to the Leafteck® technology, Inokem® 1105 can be formulated with no drier (matt) or much lower drier levels (low PVC paints). Early tack reduction hardness development, less yellowing with time are key improvements. Inokem® 1105 bio content is around 50% on dry product.",
