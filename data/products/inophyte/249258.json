    "description": "ElastaGLO® Hydrolyzed Elastin is a highly elastic protein in the connective tissue which allows skin to return to its original position when stretched. Collagen is the main component of skin; elastin holds the collagen bundles together and gives skin its elasticity. Aging causes elastin production to slow down, therefore skin loses elasticity and wrinkles begin to form. Elastin helps restore the elasticity of skin. Hydrolyzed elastin has been shown to provide additional benefits, including improvements in vascular elasticity and blood flow. It supports joint mobility, healthy ligaments, and a healthy, non-sagging bust. Hydrolyzed elastin can also be considered for a surgical recovery product.",
