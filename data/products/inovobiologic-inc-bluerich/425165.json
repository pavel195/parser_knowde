    "description": "Liquid Coenzyme Q10 (Nano) is considered a sort of cellular spark plug, igniting the cell’s oxygen to produce energy. As an antioxidant CoQ10 also protects us from damaging free radicals. Aging reduces the body’s stores of CoQ10 and this decline may be responsible for some aspects of degenerative diseases.",
