    "description": "  IodAID™ is derived from upcycling the by-products of two brown seaweeds, Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus, which are sustainably harvested from the North Atlantic Ocean. Through a water-based manufacturing process, these by-products are concentrated to provide essential minerals and trace elements found naturally in seaweeds. This bioprocess also reduces sodium levels, making IodAID™ a low-sodium product. Containing iodine, other minerals, fucoidan, and polyphenols, IodAID™ helps provide essential micronutrients for good health. Its high iodine content offers numerous benefits, including hormonal health, cognitive health, skin health, and energy metabolism.Ingredient of natural and plant origin from brown algae.",
