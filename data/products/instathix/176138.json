    "description": "HIPEgel® Oleo C is a COSMOS-approved version of HIPEgel® Oleo which enables the formulator to make high oil HIPEs (High Internal Phase Emulsions) easily, at room temperature. The oil phase is typically greater than 90% and the resulting emulsion is o/w, meaning that the formula is light and has a ‘quick break’ effect. Due to the nature of the polygonal packing of oil droplets in the structure, stable viscous systems are made without the use of added thickeners.",
