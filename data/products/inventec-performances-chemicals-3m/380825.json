    "description": "ABchimie™ DVA BA is a non-toxic solvent blend that can be used with any acrylic-based conformal coating. Used specifically for AVR80 BA acrylic coating. Thinners are primarily used to dilute coatings for use in dip and spray coating. ABchimie™ DVA BA is a specific thinner that allows you to reduce the amount of thinner in the mix with AVR80 BA to achieve a higher thickness on the pcb when spraying with a gun (mix is 1:1).",
