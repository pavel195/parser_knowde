    "description": "ABchimie™ 746E UV LED is a single transparent component designed to protect printed circuit boards in harsh environments. It has dual cure technology (UV/LED - humidity) for shadow crosslinking. ABchimie746E UV LED can be applied using a brush, pad printing, spray machine, and, of course, a selective coating machine, which is the best method. Because of our system's low viscosity, we can limit the thickness to around 80 microns.",
