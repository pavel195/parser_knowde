    "description": "3M™ Novec 1700 is a single component fluorinated polymer that has been diluted in 3MTM NovecTM 7100DL Engineered Fluid, a segregated hydrofluoroether solvent, to produce a low viscosity, low surface tension coating solution. It dries to an ultrathin, transparent coating with excellent hydrophobic and oleophobic properties, making it ideal for moisture and corrosion protection of printed circuit boards and electronic components. It does not require curing and is simple to apply. According to the US EPA, Novec 1700 coating is nonflammable, non-ozone depleting, low in toxicity, low in GWP, RoHS compliant, and VOC exempt.",
