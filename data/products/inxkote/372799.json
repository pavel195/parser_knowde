    "description": "GelFlex-EB™ Electron Beam Flexographic inks help brand owners and printers achieve their sustainability goals by reducing or eliminating lamination layers in favor of surface print. They are ultra-high solid, gel-based inks which are fluid enough for CI flexo printing, but thicken rapidly, providing effective high-speed ink trapping in the wet state. With GelFlex-EB™ you can produce a wide array of eye-catching print designs using multi-colored palettes as well as various tactile packaging surfaces.",
