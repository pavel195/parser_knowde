    "description": "BioVigor® is a polyphenoly plant extract. Its complex mixture is organically extracted from high grade carbon complexes formed naturally millions of years ago. Our patented extraction process then extracts the organic materials and transforms them into a highly concentrated ionic mineral complex packed with antioxidants. Unlike any other on the market, it is extracted in an organic way that maintains its purity and high quality which is evident in its rich vibrant golden color which we refer to as the “Golden Standard.”.",
