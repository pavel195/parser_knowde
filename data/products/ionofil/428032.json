    "description": "IonoGrind 105 is a innovative technology that makes one out of two: grinding and rotary eroding in one machine. This saves time and money. Thatâ€˜s why oelheld developed a fluid especially adapted to this process. IonoGrind is a multifunctional fluid that is equally suitable for spark erosion and as a grinding oil. It was designed for use in combination machines (two in one) and combines the advantages of a high-performance dielectric for the extremely high removal rate and surface quality with a low-foaming and low-evaporation grinding oil. IonoGrind is the right medium for eroding and grinding PCD (polycrystalline diamonds), HSS and tungsten carbide, as its special composition prevents the release of cobalt. By using special high-pressure additives, IonoGrind also achieves maximum grinding performance.",
