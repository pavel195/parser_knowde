    "description": "IonoVit 0 is a water-based product with proper additives and guarantees the production of reproducible and high-quality drillings for electrode diameters starting from 0,1 mm. IonoVit 0 is a ready-to-use product, so that mixing is not necessary. The Brix value is in a range of 5% â€“ 7%. A dielectric aggregate (water treatment) is required which, in combination with a mixed resin cartridge, ensures good quality and keeps the water conductance at less than 10 uS/cm. If the water conductance increases, the mixed resin cartridge must be replaced. The medium should also be cooled, because otherwise no constant performance can be achieved. For this product it is recommended to integrate a cooling spiral into the existing cooling circuit (recommended for reproducible quality).",
