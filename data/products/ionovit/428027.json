    "description": "IME 63 is a dielectric for EDM die-sinking machines. IME 63 have been tested in extensive trials and have proven to be effective in practice for decades. The series is explicitly recommended by leading manufacturers of electrical discharge machines. IME dielectrics have the highest dielectric strength, are clear and almost odorless. Their color does not change during erosion. They reach the purity level of pharmaceutical white oils and are practically free of aromatic compounds. Whether in rough cut applications or for use in fine operations, the dielectric must meet the specific requirements of each application. The high-performance dielectrics for use in electrical discharge machining are manufactured on a synthetic basis and are therefore particularly resistant to aging.",
