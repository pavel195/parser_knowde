    "description": "Hydrosol P135 is a white spirits mixture of paraffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbons. Standard qualities contain up to 20% mass fraction of aromatic compounds. By using suitable raw materials and hydrogenation processes, we are able to produce these products with only a mild odor. The high naphthenic content is what gives DHC white spirits their increased solvating power.",
