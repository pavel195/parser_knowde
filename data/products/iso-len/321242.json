    "description": "ISO TECH Kunststoff GmbH ISO-MOL is a self-lubricating material based on PE-UHMW with significantly improved sliding friction and abrasion resistance. As a further development of our material ISO-LEN速 1000, the addition of additives achieves excellent wear behavior and an excellent coefficient of sliding friction. ISO-MOL速 is mainly used in systems in which downtimes are very costly. In particular, slide rails and chain guide profiles as well as linings in the bulk goods sector are often manufactured on the basis of ISO-MOL速 .",
