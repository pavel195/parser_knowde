    "description": "FreshStat™ (Cetylpyridinium Chloride in Propylene Glycol) is a CPC-based colorless, odorless liquid providing great formulation versatility due to its effectiveness across a broad pH range (between 4-10). FreshStat™ can be used both, as a preservative and deodorizing agent that is safe and efficacious at very low concentrations against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi in leave on and rinse off formulations. CPC is approved as a cosmetics preservative in Japan.  Also the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) finalized a favorable safety opinion for CPC in cosmetics.",
