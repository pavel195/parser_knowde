    "description": "Oleum Sulfonated Alkyl-Aryl Sulfonic Acid Sulfon™ 90 is a highly active sulfonic acid produced from oleum sulfonation of heavy alkylate bottoms (HAB).It is recommended as an intermediate for the manufacture of oil soluble metallic sulfonates for the automotive, metalworking, coatings and grease industries. The sulfonates produced from Sulfon™ 90 exhibit low odor and good rust and corrosion inhibiting characteristic. They are generally compatible with a variety of basestocks and impart good detergent and dispersant properties. Sulfon™ 90 is also readily convertible to gelled, crystalline calcium sulfonate.\r\n",
