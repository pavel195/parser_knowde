    "description": "Albion® Minerals Calcium Bisglycinate Chelate, this fully reacted mineral chelate is one of the most bioavailable forms of calcium. Each calcium molecule is bound to two glycine molecules through Albion’s well proven chelation process, transforming it into an amino acid chelate that has nearly twice the absorption rate of calcium citrate or calcium carbonate. The chelate structure is then confirmed through FT-IR spectroscopy testing.",
