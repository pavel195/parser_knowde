    "description": "KALMATRON® KC is a chemically active admixture to cement‐containing mixes that increases the cementitious value and volume of cement grain. KF-A is a liquid, concrete admixture functioning as an inorganic oxidizer of micro-metal elements contained in the cementitious materials to provide extension of cement gel surface by decay-hydration of the cement grain from 100 µm to 10 µm. KC is a cost‐effective solution that provides a transformation of conventional concrete mix to High Performance concrete. KC makes concrete strong and durable without the need of any other admixture and/or supplement materials or future applications.",
