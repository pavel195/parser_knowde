In a case if KF-B layer damaged, protected structure stays impermeable and densified. KF-B is best for repair of water supply and sewer systems; marine and fortification structures; facilities of the chemical and agricultural industries. Applied as a layer, it has no expansion in both the plastic and hardening phases without compensation of water. Layer of KF-B is a water impermeable under the hydraulic pressure at 14 [bar] and stable to aggressive environment at pH of 1.",
