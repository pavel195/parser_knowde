    "description": "KEPA 1130 is a special polymer rubber of the ethylene-propylene EPDM, consisted mainly with single molecular chain structure, grafted with maleic anhydride. It is superior in the resistances against heat, ozone, and weather, also shows excellent characteristic of the impact strength in low temperature as it is constituted with amorphous rubber.",
