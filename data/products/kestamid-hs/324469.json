    "description": "Efalon® Bronze-filled B-40 is added in percentages of weight between 40 and 60%. PTFE Bronze filled has the best wear properties, remarkable compression strengths and good thermal conductivity, but poor electrical characteristics and chemical resistance. It is often used in hydraulic systems, particularly superb as linear bearings, e.g. slides, gibs, guide ways. The compound is easily machined. Bronze-filled is useful in applications which undergo high mechanical loads or high-speed rubbing contacts where the bronze filler supplies the strength and conductivity to carry away excess, unwanted heat.",
