    "description": "Ulpolen速 300 offers increased wear resistance and impact strength compared to HDPE. It is extremely strong, has excellent resistance to chemicals and low temperatures and has very low moisture absorption. Ulpolen速PE300-HDPE (high-density polyethylene) offers excellent impact resistance, light weight, low moisture absorption, and high tensile strength. HDPE is also non-toxic and non-staining and meets FDA and USDA certification for food processing.",
