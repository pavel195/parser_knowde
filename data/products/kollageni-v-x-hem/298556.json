Hydroxytyrosol is a natural phytochemical with the highest antioxidant properties discovered to date. Olea25® is the result of a unique patent pending production and purification process that yields an unprecedented 25% hydroxytyrosol content. The Oleuropein has been completely tranferred through a biotransformation process into the bioactive hydroxytyrosol. No Oleuropein residue remains in final product!",
