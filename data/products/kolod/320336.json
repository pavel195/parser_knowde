    "description": "Ammonium Sulfate is colorless transparent orthorhombic crystal,deliquescent.The relative density is 1.769(50℃). It’s easily soluble in water (At 0℃, solubility is 70.6g/100mL water; 100℃, 103.8g/100mL water). Aqueous solution is acidic. It’s insoluble in ethanol, acetone or ammonia. It reacts with the alkalies to form ammonia. According to GB 2760-2011, it could be used as processing aid (only used as nutrient for fermentation). It also could be used as dough regulator and yeast food. In the fresh yeast production, it’s used as the nitrogen source for yeast cultivation (Dosage is not specified.). Dosage is about 10% (about 0.25% of wheat powder) for yeast nutrient in bread.",
