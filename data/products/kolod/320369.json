    "description": "Sodium Hexametaphosphate is colorless transparent flake like foliated glass or float sand crystalline powder. It’s easily soluble in water, insoluble in organic solvent such as ethanol and ether. It absorbs moisture easily. When put in air, it could slowly absorb moisture and turn into viscose-like substance. Aqueous solution could react with metal ions such as Calcium, Magnesium, to form complex compound. Melting point is 616℃ (decompose). Relative density is 2.484g/cm3 (20℃). It is used as quality improver, pH regulator, chelating agent, binder and swelling agent. It’s also used to stabilize natural pigment in beans, fruit vegetable cans and bean stuffing; to emulsify fat in canned meat. For canned food and meat product, it could improve their water holding capacity and prevent fat from corrosion. It may clarify beer to avoid turbidity, It’s an excellent water softener without precipitation",
