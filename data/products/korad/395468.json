    "description": "Extreme Plus LG™ sheet are both high performance thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) structures. With a wide processing range, they are specifically engineered for easy, consistent and stable thermoforming. Extreme Plus HG is our high gloss sheet, while Extreme Plus LG offers the same performance properties with the option of a lower gloss finish. These tough, high impact TPO sheets provide excellent cold crack resistance and outstanding chemical resistance. A high or low gloss, molded-in-color surface can be achieved on many applications where harsh weather, chemicals, heavy vibration or heat stresses are factors.",
