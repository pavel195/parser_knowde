    "description": "KRAIBURG FFKM is a Perfluoro-rubber used in applications such as high-quality parts such as O-rings. The unique properties of this material help to maintain seals, which can result in less maintenance, reduced operating costs and improved safety. Only seal elements made of perfluor-elastomer achieve the virtually universal chemical resistance of PTFE, without having to miss the typical sealing, resilience (compression set) and creep resistance of rubber.",
