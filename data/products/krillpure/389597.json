    "description": "Astamax® (Natural Astaxanthin Oil) 5% is a super-antioxidant. It is often called the “king of Carotenoids” because it is 10 to 100 times more powerful than other carotenoids like beta-carotene and lycopene. Astaxanthin comes with natural anti- inflammatory properties with no risk of addiction, heartburn or gastrointestinal ulcer. Furthermore, astaxanthin helps reduce wrinkles and improve skin moisture levels.",
