    "description": "Vitamin K consists of a group of fat-soluble vitamins that are considered essential to support human health. Known as menaquinone (MK), vitamin K2 is a type of vitamin K found in animal products and fermented foods. Vitamin K2 is a crucial vitamin for supporting heart and bone health. The two major forms of vitamin K2 are MK-4 and MK-7. The number denotes the number of isoprenoid residues in the side chain. MK-4 is naturally synthesized in mammalian cells and is the form that is most studied. MK-7 is naturally produced by fermentation and is discovered to have greater bioavailability. Blue California offers both MK4 and MK7 forms of vitamin K2 for your needs.",
