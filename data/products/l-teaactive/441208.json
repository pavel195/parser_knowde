    "description": "ErgoActive® L-Ergothioneine is a potent antioxidant that works inside cells to combat oxidative stress. While ergothioneine is synthesized mainly in mushrooms, fungus and soil bacteria, human cells express a transporter highly specific to ergothioneine. Despite not being produced in the body, ergothioneine is present in nearly all human cells, suggesting its significance in supporting human health. An in vitro study demonstrates that ErgoActive ® preserved telomere length and reduced the rate of telomere shortening under oxidative stress conditions, supporting the benefit of ergothioneine for healthy aging. Emerging science shows potential cognitive, immune, prostate and cardiovascular health benefits.\r\n",
