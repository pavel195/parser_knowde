    "description": "OKINACEA® targets both the dermal-epidermal junction and dermis. Its efficacy has been demonstrated by several ex vivo and in vitro studies. This product strengthens the DEJ functionality by stimulating both laminin-5 and collagen IV, therefore improving skin cohesion and increasing exchanges between the epidermis and dermis. OKINACEA® contributes to improve the skin structure, to firm the skin and reduce the saggy skin and consequently to delay the major signs of skin aging.",
