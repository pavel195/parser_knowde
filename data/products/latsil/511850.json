    "description": "Cossil® TMS 50 ID is a blend of MQ resin and isododecane, formulated for direct addition into the oil phase of formulations. It provides excellent water repellency and serves as a versatile ingredient suitable for various personal care products. Specifically, it finds application in antiperspirants, deodorants, skin care, color cosmetics, and sun care products. It is particularly beneficial in sun care creams and lotions, makeup products such as foundations and concealers, as well as color cosmetics like lipsticks, mascaras, eyeliners, and eyeshadows. Thanks to the volatility of isododecane, it exhibits fast drying properties, good water repellency, and exceptional film-forming abilities.",
