    "description": "LAVIOTHIX® P100 is product of inorganic origin based on clay, with high performances and efficiency, specific for water borne formulations that gives great pseudoplastic behavior and tixotropy. Il LAVIOTHIX® P100 is a thickening and antisettling agent, based on a selected, purified and activated white bentonite clay with a high montmorillonite content Activity is strictly correlated to its hydration capacity and to give rise to micronic an submicronic particles in dispersion, with a high specific surface; the platelets. These one contribute to create the “body” of the product to be formulated by the formation of an internal tridimensional structure within which different particles and fillers may be incorporated This elementary particles are responsible of the tixotropic, antisettling, absorbing and binding properties of the product",
