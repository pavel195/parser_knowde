    "description": "LAVIOSA VISCOGEL™ XD is a new high performing, highly effective rheological additive for solvent-borne systems of low to medium polarity. that provides thixotropic effect, sag control, excellent leveling and prevents pigments from long-term storage settling. The nature of LAVIOSA VISCOGEL™ XD is a highly purified bentonite clay, organically modified with a quaternary alkylammonium compound. Unlike most of the other conventional organoclays, LAVIOSA VISCOGEL™ XD is selfactivating and easily dispersible, hence simple and convenient to use.",
