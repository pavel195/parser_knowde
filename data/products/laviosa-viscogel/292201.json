    "description": "LAVIOSA VISCOGEL™ ED2 is a newhigh performing, highly effective rheological additive for solvent-borne systems of moderate to high polarity. that provides thixotropic effect, sag control, excellent leveling and prevents pigments from long-term storage settling. The nature of LAVIOSA VISCOGEL™ ED2 is a highly purified bentonite clay, organically modified with a quaternary alkylammonium compound. Unlike most of the other conventional organoclays, LAVIOSA VISCOGEL™ ED2 is selfactivating and easily dispersible, hence simple and convenient to use.",
