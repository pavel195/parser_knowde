    "description": "Leepoxy Plastics 17015 is a proprietary Freon-resistant epoxy specifically developed for patching magnet wire coatings in refrigeration motors whose wires are scraped, nicked, or chipped, thus exposing the copper substrate. It is thixotropic enough not to drip or slump off the wire. After a room temperature set and either an immediate or subsequent post heat cure, LEEPOXY 8-46 forms a highly-cross-linked plastic with excellent adhesion, mechanical and electrical properties. Resistance to Freon is excellent, but only with sufficient post cure. Post cure can occur during dehydration, varnish cure, or other processes any time prior to exposure to Freon.",
