    "description": "LEECAST 20-73 is a two-part, reversion resistant, electrical grade room temperature curing potting compound. It is a unique urethane system that contains neither MOCA nor TDI. LEECAST 20-73 is designed to provide excellent dielectric properties over a wide temperature range. It has good low temperature flexibility and is ideally suited for protecting pressure sensitive glass diodes and other electronic devices. Its low viscosity and long pot life make it attractive for penetrating complex modules and for the aggregate casting method of encapsulation and potting. LEECAST 20-73 also features excellent reversion resistance or hydrolytic stability.",
