    "description": "LEECAST 23-130-5 is a unique urethane system that contains neither MOCA nor TDI. LEECAST 23-130-5 is designed to provide excellent dielectric properties over a wide temperature range. It has good low temperature flexibility and is ideally suited for protecting pressure sensitive glass diodes and other fragile electrical circuitry in UL-listed products. Its low viscosity and long pot life make it attractive for penetrating complex modules and for the aggregate casting method of encapsulation and potting. LEECAST 23-130-5 also features excellent reversion resistance and hydrolytic stability.",
