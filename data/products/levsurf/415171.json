    "description": "LevSurf F18 is a 3D formable film for IMD processing. The hard coating is fully cured which prevents damage during processing and during the lifetime of the product. The foil has a high optical qualty with the intention of integrating high resolution displays. The PC base film is printable with suitable inks for IMD processing. LevSurfTM is a UV cured film for film insert molding (IMD/FIM) with excellent hardness and formability. Due to the high optical quality it can substitute display glass, lowering the vehicle weight and therefore contributing to the reduction of cost and CO2 emissions.",
