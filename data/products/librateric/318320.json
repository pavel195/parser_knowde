This product is insoluble in water but has a wide range of applications in oil and solvent systems. As an anionic substance, Libratex DOS70K is compatible with both anionic and nonionic surfactants. It is particularly valuable in agricultural formulations, where it aids in the emulsification of oils and solvents. Additionally, it finds use in lubricants, dispersants, and paints, offering excellent wetting abilities and oil solubility, enhancing performance in these applications.\r\n",
