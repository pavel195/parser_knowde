    "description": "Naturex CHIPOTLE IN ADOBO (NV01SB50) is produced using fresh, whole, fully ripened red jalape√±o peppers. These peppers are meticulously washed and destemmed before being subjected to natural wood smoking, imparting a distinctive smoky, spicy flavor. The smoked peppers then undergo further processing, involving acidification with vinegar and heat pasteurization, resulting in the creation of our unique Chipotle in Adobo. It's important to note that these products adhere to strict processing standards in compliance with FDA and State of California Department of Health regulations.",
