    "description": "Naturex CHIPOTLE PEPPER SAUCE CONCENTRATE (NV01SB54) is produced using fresh, fully ripened red jalape√±o peppers. The peppers undergo a meticulous process that includes washing and de-stemming, followed by natural wood smoking to impart a distinctively smoky and spicy pepper flavor. These smoked peppers then undergo further processing, involving acidification with vinegar and heat pasteurization, ultimately resulting in the creation of the unique Chipotle Pepper Sauce Concentrate. It's essential to note that this product is manufactured in full compliance with FDA and State of California Department of Health regulations, ensuring its quality and safety.",
