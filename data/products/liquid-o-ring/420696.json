    "description": "Liquid-O-Ring® PM600MN1 is a heavy-duty, all-purpose lubricant made with moly. It is tacky and has very high shockabsorbing abilities. PM600M is manufactured with exceptional adhesive and cohesive properties, allowing longer service intervals. PM600M forms a lubricating film that prevents metal-to-metal contact and reduces operating temperatures. It is non-melting, water resistant, and protects against corrosion as it lubricates. PM600M is available in NLGI grades 1, 2, and 3.",
