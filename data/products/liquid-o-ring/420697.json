    "description": "Liquid-O-Ring® PM800 is a heavy-duty, high temperature, allpurpose lubricant. It is sightly tacky and has a high melting point of +500°F (260°C). PM800 is manufactured with slight adhesive and cohesive properties, allowing longer service intervals. PM800 forms a lubricating film that prevents metal-to-metal contact and reduces operating temperatures. It is water resistant and protects against corrosion as it lubricates.",
