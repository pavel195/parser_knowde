    "description": "Liquid-O-Ring® 751 is an industrial multi-purpose gear lubricant with load carrying ability and water separating characteristics. It coats all parts of the gearbox; eliminating water contact and preventing corrosion. 751 Gear Oil allows minimum viscosity change, extends the service life of gearboxes, and reduces downtime. Extreme pressure properties allow 751 Gear Oil to lubricate gears resulting in smoother and quieter running, cooler gears, and longer overhaul intervals.",
