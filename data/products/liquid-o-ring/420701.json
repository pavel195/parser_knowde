    "description": "Liquid-O-Ring® PM10080W90 is a heavy-duty, premium gear oil manufactured using highly-refined paraffinic base oils. PM100 Gear Oil is formulated with outstanding extreme pressure (EP) characteristics and load-carrying properties intended for use in all gearboxes. Extreme conditions, extended running times, and inclement weather conditions, are common in on and off-road operations—PM100 Gear Oil was developed to protect gears from major problems, particularly water contamination, overheating, heavy loads, and wear. PM100 Gear Oil exceeds the demands placed on gear oil used in automotive and heavy-duty equipment.",
