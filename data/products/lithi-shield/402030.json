    "description": "RAIL EQUIPMENT SHIELD™ is the ultimate protection for the moving metal parts in light rail transit, heavy railroad equipment, locomotive, and Maintenance of Way. Utilizing the most Advanced Boundary Film (ABF) Technology, it protects moving metal parts from heat, friction and wear in engines, transmissions, differentials, transfer cases, hydraulic pumps and motors, gear boxes, and other enclosed lubrication systems, due to boundary conditions of frictional abrasion, extreme pressure torque, dry startup and shutdown. Increased train velocity and on-time train performance are the results when costly set-outs, maintenance repairs and downtime are reduced. These performance goals are achieved through ABF Technology by lowering the operating temperatures, extending the life of component parts and increasing reliability.",
