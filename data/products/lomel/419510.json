    "description": "LM-145 is ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer film. The LM-145 grade of plastic film and bags is derived from ethylene copolymers made using the Metallocene or Single Site catalyst technology. LM-145 film and bags are the lowest melting batch inclusion material on the market today. They can be heat sealed and printed. Testing should be done to determine optimum sealing temperatures.",
