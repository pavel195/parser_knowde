    "description": "LM-205 is ethylene copolymer film. The LM-205 line of plastic film and bags are derived from a family of ethylene copolymers made using the Metallocene or Single Site catalyst technology. They have demonstrated excellent chemical resistance and have a low water vapor transmission rate for packaging moisture-sensitive materials. LM-205 film has proven to make a good middle-range melting bale wrap were stripping the film has been a problem with other polyolefin materials. Testing should be done to determine optimum sealing temperatures.",
