    "description": "LubBase® 100 is a Group II oil that is refined from petroleum using advanced hydrocracking techniques. We transform crude oil molecules into water-white base oils that are almost completely free of aromatics, polar compounds, and sulfur. Some of the more advanced oils use a catalytic de-waxing process to create a highly pure product.",
