    "description": "BDT-4330 is a dendritic acrylate with an average functionality of 30.  The hyper-branched structure of BDT-4330 imparts the unique combination of low diluted viscosity with unmatched chemical and thermal resistance, which is ideal in applications where withstanding exposure to the harshest conditions is paramount.  Great for high-temperature applications because thermogravimetric analysis indicates the oligomer doesn’t decompose until 397° C",
