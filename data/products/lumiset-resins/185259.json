    "description": "Bomar™BR-640Dis a polybutadiene (PBD) urethane acrylate with a functionality of two. Designed to meet rigorous electronic applications, BR-640D has many desirable properties typical to PBD resins, combined with radiation curability. In applications requiring thermal cycling resistance, BR-640Dwithstands the extremes of temperature typical of such tests, without undue degradation of properties.Excellent hydrophobic properties exhibited where 0.012 and 0.037% water was absorbed by cured coating when submerged in water for 24 hours.  In addition to the adhesion properties, BR-640D showed excellent adhesion to ABS, acrylic, nylon-6, PVC, and PS.",
