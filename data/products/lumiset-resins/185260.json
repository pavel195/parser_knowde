    "description": "Bomar™ BR-641D is a Polybutadiene (PBD) urethane acrylate, which was designed to meet rigorous electronic coating applications. This oligomer has exceptional adhesion to various metals, glass,and polycarbonate substrates. BR-641D has many desirable properties that are typical to PBD resins, combined with radiation curability. In applications requiring thermal cycling resistance, BR-641D withstands the extremes of temperature typical of such tests, without undue degradation of properties. In addition to the adhesion properties listed in the table below, BR-641D showed excellent adhesion to PMMA, ABS, PVC, Nylon-6, Polystyrene,and Polypropylene.",
