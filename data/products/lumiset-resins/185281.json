    "description": "BR-5541M is a flexible polyether urethane methacrylate oligomer diluted in 20% IBOA with a low modulus, good adhesion to a variety of substrates, and excellent elasticity. The high molecular weight of the backbone structure offers improved elasticity and rebound versus similar high elongation materials. The low modulus of the material allows for a high degree of flexibility comparable to silicone-based materials such as BRS-14320S, but with improved compatibility and surface cure. The compressibility of the material also offers potential usage in gasket and sealing applications.",
