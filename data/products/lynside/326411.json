    "description": "VitaMK7® is the optimal vitamin K2 product, with more than 99% all-trans menaquinone (MK7). MK7 is the only active form of vitamin K2. The bacteria in our gut cannot produce enough vitamin K2 alone – which is why nutraceuticals and functional foods and beverages are produced with VitaMK7®. VitaMK7® is known for regulating calcium in the body, keeping it from the cardiovascular system and driving it to the bones. From childhood to old age, VitaMK7® supports stronger bones throughout our entire lives. The result of a patented biotransformation process of Bacillus subtilis, VitaMK7®‘s production does not rely on other chemical compounds.",
