    "description": "Phosphocomplex® is a synergistic, highly bioavailable complex of Silybin and Phosphatidylcholine, supporting liver health. Silybin is the most abundant and potent constituent of silymarin, the most active ingredient of milk thistle plant (Silybum marianum) that has been extensively studied for its benefits in liver health. Unfortunately, Silybin has traditionally had poor intestinal absorption and a low bioavailability. Phosphocomplex® improves Silybum’s capacity to reach circulation, resulting in enhanced bioavailability. Through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, the Silybin contained in Phosphocomplex® has the capacity to protect and normalize liver functions, also promoting the production of glutathione.",
