    "description": "MAC-Guard™ MAC-710 Primer is a 100% reactive, acrylic resin based on methyl-methacrylate (MMA) that cures in one hour. The product's low viscosity allows it to penetrate and reinforce concrete substrates. Applying MAC-710 to properly prepared concrete is the first step to the installation of any MAC-Guard acrylic flooring system. MAC-710 can also be applied to other substrates.",
