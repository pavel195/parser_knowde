    "description": "G-Hexuron is the stabilized form of Vitamin C that can be topically applied to the skin in advanced formulations specifically targeted for anti-aging and photo-protection benefits. G-Hexuron is the water soluble, Vitamin C, 2-derivative with superior formulation stability. G-Hexuron is both bioavailable and bioactive in its 2-glucoside form and has been shown to be more bio-persistent over time vs. Vitamin C. G-Hexuron is photo-protective, visibly lightens skin and possesses anti-aging properties similar to Vitamin C.",
