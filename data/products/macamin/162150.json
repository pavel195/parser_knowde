    "description": "SkinBrite-30™ is a water soluble, diamide salt of azelaic acid that improves the technical characteristics for formulation. Azelaic acid itself has very poor water solubility, however, it is found in many grain proteins and is a beneficial component of the skin. Azelaic acid in the skin is a signaling compound for inflammation and induces the production of salicylic acid. The Potassium Azeloyl Diglycinate derivative is a safe, highly effective and multifunctional cosmetic ingredient. As the diamide potassium salt, SkinBrite-30 is a new ingredient that resolves many of the formulation difficulties of azelaic acid. SkinBrite-30 offers water solubility, requires less dosage, and has beneficial effects against inflammation.\r\n",
