    "description": "SAP-Hexuron™ (SAP) is a stable vitamin C derivative that is cleaved enzymatically in the skin to release active vitamin C. It is produced by direct phosphorylation of ascorbic acid sodium salt where I-acorbic acid is suspended in oxygenated, nonhydroxylic solvent together with sodium and then treated with a phosphorylating agent. SAP-Hexuron™ is soluble in water and does not degrade in aqueous formulas. It is also an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals, effectively slowing down the aging process and formation of fine lines and wrinkles.\r\n",
