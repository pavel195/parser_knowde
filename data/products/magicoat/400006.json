    "description": "Designed for all Inkcups’ digital printers, the BB ultra flexible ink for plastic is cured instantly by UV LED light. The BB Series digital ink offers bright, vibrant colors, excellent adhesion, and high abrasion resistance. BB ink will bend and fold with ease without cracking or distorting the print. Ideal for flexible drinkware such as bike bottles. So don’t get stuck with a sub-par label or a 1-color print, go digital with full-color prints direct to flexible plastic and upgrade your graphics.",
