    "description": "Magna-Cryl™ 2807 is a clear, UV curable lamination adhesive for bonding flexible or rigid materials such as mylar, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyester, or PVC. It is particularly suited for applications where optical clarity is mandatory. Best results are achieved when MagnaCryl 2807 is cured through one of the substrates, However, it can be also be cured first before substrates are joined. It may be applied by flat or rotary screen. Recommended mesh count ranges from 90 to 110. We recommend curing the MagnaCryl 2807 with one 300 watt lamp.",
