    "description": "Magnalube®-G is a non-soap polyurea lubricating grease formulated with the highest quality raw materials. Magnalube®-G has a unique formula that blends PTFE and polyurea for superior performance. The grease will prevent breakdowns, and extend operating intervals in most cases. It is fortified with a number of proprietary additives that inhibit rust and oxidation as well as giving added resistance to extreme pressure. Magnalube®-G has a dropping point of well over 500°F. It performs well in harsh environments, especially when users want to avoid migration and water washout. This is a superb all-purpose grease, and is often found to solve problems that other greases cannot.",
