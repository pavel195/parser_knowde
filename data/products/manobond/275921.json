This dispersant provides better jetness in carbon black pigment dispersions and also improves color development in difficult to disperse organic pigments in both water- and solvent-based systems. It provides shorter grind times, higher gloss performance, high jetness, low viscosity dispersions, and long-term viscosity.",
