    "description": "Borchi® Gen 0851 is a Wetting and Dispersing Agent for Organic Pigments / Color Development / High Jetness in Carbon Black Pigments.\nCarbon black and organic pigments are difficult to disperse in water-based formulations. Borchi® Gen 0851 is a non-ionic wetting and dispersing agent, designed to efficiently achieve maximum color generation and high jetness in aqueous compositions. The dispersing agent is high molecular weight and VOC-free. Borchi® Gen 0451 dispersant works well in solvent-based coatings. Borchi® Gen 0851 is a high molecular weight non-ionic and VOC-free dispersant for organic pigments and carbon black in water-based coatings.",
