    "description": "MARFRAN® E CDP 50A is a TPE-S compound based on SEBS modified with specific intrinsically conductive polymers in order to obtain a material with high capability to discharge the electrostatic charges. The electrical conduction mechanism based on Intrinsically Conductive Polymer ensures that this capability is permanent, regardless of the conditions of use of the product. The MARFRAN® E CDP also guarantees a good level of physical and mechanical\ncharacteristics. ",
