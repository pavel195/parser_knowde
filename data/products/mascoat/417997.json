    "description": "Mascoat® 400DFP is a hi-temp dry fall silicone copolymer primer designed for heated substrates up to 400°F. The one-part coating’s dry fall properties allow it to dry to a powder within 10 - 20 feet from point of application, allowing it to safely be used in areas where overspray damage to nearby cars and equipment would be a concern. It offers maximum adhesion and corrosion protection even in limited surface preparation areas and does not require a heat cure. Engineered specifically for heavy industrial equipment, M-400DFP may be used on any service area ranging from ambient to 400°F for premium corrosion protection.",
