These highly concentrated dry surfactants offer formulators efficient and low carbon alternatives to traditional liquid surfactants. Given their excellent foaming property, Masphate® Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) is often used in various personal and home products such as toothpaste, hand soaps, body wash, detergents, and dishwashing liquids. It is also commonly used in industrial applications including emulsion polymerization and gypsum board manufacturing, and in agricultural formulations as a wetting agent. Free of 1,4 dioxane; Masphate® SLS provides formulators with a valued ingredient option in their pursuit of regulatory-compliant, efficient, and effective cleaning formulations. Masphate® SLS is offered in three product forms including needles, granules, and powder.",
