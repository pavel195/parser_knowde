    "description": "Selenis Maven MS 110 is a copolyester with a slow crystallization rate and is suitable for the extrusion of heavy gage sheets, allowing for thicknesses up to 4mm, without crystallization occurring. Selenis Maven MS 110 is the most economic solution for flat sheets up to this thickness range, when good clarity, surface gloss, and neutral edge color are required.",
