    "description": "Maven NF 300 is an economical solution for the extrusion of heavy gage sheet that allows for high thicknesses without crystallization occurring. Selenis Maven NF 300 is an amorphous copolyester that has been specifically developed for the extrusion of heavy gage sheets, allowing for high thicknesses without crystallization occurring. Selenis Maven NF 300 is a very economical polymer for this highly competitive market environment. In competition with other polymers frequently used in the heavy gage sheet business such as Polycarbonate, PMMA and Polystyrene Selenis Maven NF 300 is sensibly priced while featuring excellent clarity, good surface gloss, and a practically neutral edge color.Â ",
