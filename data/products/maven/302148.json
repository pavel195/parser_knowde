    "description": "Selenis Maven NF 411 is an amorphous copolyester that has been specifically developed for the extrusion of heavy gage sheets, allowing for high thicknesses without crystallization occurring. Selenis Maven NF 411 is the best possible solution when exceptional clarity, surface gloss, and neutral edge color are required. Selenis Maven NF 411 is recommended when a very demanding performance and outstanding toughness are essential, such as, maximum impact strength at low temperatures and good chemical resistance to detergents and other household cleaning agents. Thanks to its inherent toughness, sheets produced from Selenis Maven NF 411 may be down-gaged without compromising performance. Cost-savings are possible given that there is no need to pre-dry the sheets. Selenis Maven NF 411 is easy to process on standard extrusion lines. Sheets made with Selenis Maven NF 411 may be easily thermoformed, cold-bent, drilled, sawed, screwed, adhesive bonded, routed and personalized though different methods of decoration. All Maven grades are BPA and styrene free.",
