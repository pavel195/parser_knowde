    "description": "Benda-Lutz Leafing 1031 provides a strong reflective metal layer at the paint surface giving high metallic brilliance and gloss. It exhibits high surface tension due to which the pigment migrates towards the surface of paint film. This enrichment at the boundary protects the paint film from weathering, radiation and corrosion. Preferred applications include corrosion protection, reflective, maintenance, marine, roof, high heat resistance, chrome effect, and aerosol paints and coatings.",
