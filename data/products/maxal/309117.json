    "description": "Benda-Lutz Leafing 1041 exhibits high surface tension due to which the pigment migrates towards the surface of paint film. This enrichment at the boundary protects the paint film from weathering, radiation and corrosion. Provides a strong reflective metal layer at the paint surface giving high metallic brilliance and gloss. Preferred applications include corrosion protection, reflective, maintenance, marine, roof, high heat resistance, chrome effect, and aerosol paints and coatings.",
