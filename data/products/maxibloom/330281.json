    "description": "FloraGro® is part of FloraSeries®, the O.G. 3-Part Hydroponic-Based Nutrient System. More than 40 years ago, when the other guys were still in grade school, our scientists were hard at work with a mission: to give growers a consistent and precise way to feed their plants through every growth phase. First formulated in 1976, Flora Series is the original 3-part hydroponic-based nutrient system consisting of FloraGro®, FloraBloom® and FloraMicro®. Good things really do come in threes.",
