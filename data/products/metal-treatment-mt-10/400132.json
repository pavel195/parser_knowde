    "description": "Metal Treatment MT-10® lubrication technology is based on tribologic methods that improve lubricity and load-carrying capacity by improving metal surface characteristics and creating a stable, chemical, corrosion-controlled, halide boundary film. MT-10® is a blend of highly refined oils and proprietary additives and contains no solid lubricants, chlorinated solvents or phosphate compounds. It is engineered to treat the metal not the oil using tribologic methods that improve metal surface characteristics to increase lubricity and load-carrying capacity.",
