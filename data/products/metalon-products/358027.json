    "description": "Metalon M Anti-Wear Friction Fighter is a hydrocarbon complex specifically formulated to help reduce friction and wear of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and save energy. Unlike oil additives, METALON M unites chemically with the metal component molecules to form a microscopic, monomolecular wear-resistant shield. Blended with most synthetic or petroleum oils, the exclusive METALON M formula helps to reduce maintenance costs and increase production and service life of mechanical equipment. When combined with conventional metal cutting and machining oils, METALON M helps to maintain the sharpness of the tool cutting edges, allows deeper cuts per pass, while producing a smoother finish with less energy. Applied to the lubrication systems of new equipment, METALON M substantially reduces the extensive wear and metal removal associated with “break-in” periods; thereby increasing equipment longevity. METALON M creates a burnished, precision fit between mating parts, which reduces friction. One of the significant and unique characteristics of METALON M is its chemical bonding capability. METALON M will not drain off metal surfaces during idle periods, but rather remains in place to protect the parts during cold starts.",
