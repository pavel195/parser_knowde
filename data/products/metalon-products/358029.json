    "description": "Metalon Hi-Tech Ep 1.5 Grease is a superior multi-use, high temperature, over-based complex lubricant. The principle of over-basing is not new. Calcium sulphonates have provided mechanical and thermal stability and exceptional resistance to water and corrosion for many years. However, the dispensing, pump-ability and low temperature properties were poor. Through sophisticated research in complexing methods, a new generation of grease has been developed, which offers extra bonuses. The unique combination of this latest grease technology of over-based complex calcium sulphonates, PLUS 1.5 penetration, PLUS METALON EP offers characteristics and qualities unmatched by lithium or other greases. its penetration of NLGI 1.5 bridges the no. 1 and no. 2 grades. reduces inventories and misapplication problems, while enhancing the pumpability and dispensing properties.",
