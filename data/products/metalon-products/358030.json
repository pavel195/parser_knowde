    "description": "Metalon Spray Lubricant/Cleaner is a hydrocarbon complex specifically formulated to help reduce wear and friction of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. METALON unites chemically with the metal component molecules, forming a microscopic, monomolecular, wear-resistant shield. This exclusive lubricating formula combines the extraordinary features of METALON with other components that meet Military Specification requirements. METALON SPRAY PENETRANT will help to increase production and service life of equipment, reduce down-time and crucial wasteful maintenance expenditures. METALON SPRAY PENETRANT is Non-Flammable. This provides an important margin of safety where potential hazards exist. lts high dielectric strength permits effective cleaning and retardation of electrical corrosion. The penetrating and \"creep\" properties help to free, lubricate and protect rusted and seized components. Moisture is driven out. A little goes a long way, which makes METALON SPRAY PENETRANT very cost effective.",
