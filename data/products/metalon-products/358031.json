    "description": "Metalon Downhole Tool Oil provides the ultimate solution to the many obstacles confronting Downhole Tool Operations. Often times these depths exceed more than 5000 feet. The drilling tools, which vary in “diameter”, are subjected to tremendous pressure and friction causing very high temperatures. These very same factors adversely affect the bearings and races in the TOOL assembly. When this occurs, much time and increased costs are incurred. Metalon products delivers the practical solution.",
