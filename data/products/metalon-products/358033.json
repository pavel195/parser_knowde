    "description": "Metalon Products Megalene Gas System Treatment is a new and improved hydrocarbon complex that incorporates components which are ashless, non-phosphorous and perform as multi-functional detergents and dispersants. In addition, METALON bonds chemically with the metal component molecules, forming a microscopic, monomolecular friction reducing, wear resistant shield that will not drain off. The burnishing action of METALON produces a more precise metal-to-metal fit that increases component life. The efficiency of the critical fuel injectors is substantially enhanced, maintaining consistent spray patterns and accurate fuel metering. Upper cylinder components are lubricated. Supplementary to the data below, the proprietary components exceed the Military Specifications MILI-25017B and MIL-I-25017C, providing excellent rust protection in all grades of gasoline.",
