    "description": "Metalon Products Megasel Diesel Fuel System Treatment is a new and improved hydrocarbon complex that is used to maintain distillate fuel in a sludge-free stabilized condition. MEGASEL arrests many of the problems related to storage, transportation and combustion of fuels used in diesel turbines, fuel-oil burning boilers, steam generators and internal combustion engines. Diesel fuel stability is adversely affected by the widespread practice of blending fuels from different sources. Fuel degradation is accelerated causing sludge and bacteria formation and reduced combustibility. Sticking fuel injectors, contaminated fuel lines, filters and pumps waste costly fuel, reduce operating efficiency and increase maintenance costs. The problems of corrosion, rust, acid formation and water damage are also prevalent in diesel fuel systems.",
