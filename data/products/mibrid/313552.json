    "description": "Chemists often have difficulty finding high opacity, pure white powders for their formulations that remain true to color in both wet and dry conditions, a key point to developing liquid foundations. To combat this, Miyoshi America has developed MiyoHAZE White, an innovative, multi-functional opacifying powder that can be used in a wide range of cosmetic products. MiyoHAZE Whiteâ€™s unique properties display both wet and dry color fidelity with high opacity resulting in a soft-focus effect in the end formulation. MiyoHAZE White can also be surface treated to provide additional value-added benefits such as strong hydrophobicity, high coverage, and enhanced feel.",
