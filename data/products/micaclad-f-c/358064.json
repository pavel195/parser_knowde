    "description": "Conductive Silver Spheres (CHS) are highly conductive, low density, spherical powders and particles with a dry bulk resistivity of .001 ohms/cm. Offering seamless electrical continuity of pure silver at a fraction of the cost and weight. The CHS additives are noticeably lighter than solid silver in paints, Composites and adhesive, while providing excellent conductivity, the low particle density of the CSGS and large surface area facilitates slow phase\nseparation in paints and adhesives compared to heavy metallic and organic fillers. The CHS also works well when used as catalysts, laser fusion targets, and electrically conducting bond line spacers in advanced electronics and other applications.\n\nThe CHS additives are engineered for high conductivity and shielding electromagnetic interference while improving the applications impact strength. The spheres can be customized from size to silver % to fit the application.",
