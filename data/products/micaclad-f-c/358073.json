    "description": "MICACLAD F.C combines high-aspect ratio reinforcing cosmetic grade micas with the added advantage of an FDA compliant pigment sealed with an FDA compliant binding system. The result is a safe non-dispersing pigment, a vibrant color enhancement to the particle creating effects ranging from a subtle uster to a full simulated stone, the opacity of the flakes is sufficiently high to retain the reflectance in both aqueous and polymer based systems. Giving color fast pigment dispersions on a reinforcing mica particle could reduce raw material costs dramatically.",
