    "description": "FluorAcryl 1939 is a bifunctional perfluoropolyether (PFPE) urethane acrylate. FluorAcryl is a surface modifier that improves gloss. It is compatible and miscible with low molecular weight reactive UV-curable diluents and acrylic monomers. Some of the properties of FluorAcryl 1939 include good release agent, good water and oil repellency and good chemical resistance. As a surface modifier this also offers good hardness, substrate-wetting and flow-properties. Recommended dosage is between 0.5â€“5% w/w. During application and UV light curing, FluorAcryl blooms quickly and effectively on the surface of the coating, imparting low surface energy and non-stick E2C properties. FluorAcryl is made for UV curable coatings use.",
