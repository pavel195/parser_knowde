    "description": "Mighty Lube® Type 38 is a unique synthetic lubricant designed to lubricate bearings, chains, slides, and gears in industrial applications where air temperatures often exceed 500°F. They are ashless fluids and do not contain residue forming solids. In addition, Mighty Lube® Type T38 contains proprietary ashless esters to make it suitable in applications like chains and bearings that run at high temperatures. Type T38 will not leave particles behind at high temperatures.",
