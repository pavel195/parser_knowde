    "description": "Spodnam® is a unique formulation containing a di-1-p-menthene polymer, emulsifiers, and surfactants. It is a harvest management tool that helps improve yield capture and crop quality by mitigating physical effects of environmental moisture from damaging pod/pedicel integrity. Spodnam reduces the intrusion of moisture into the pedicel / seed head as the crop matures. This reduction in moisture intrusion can benefit the crop when it is exposed to rains or heavy dews during the final stages of development and dry down",
