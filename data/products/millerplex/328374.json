    "description": "Hybrid® is a proprietary High Surfactant Oil Concentrate (HSOC) that is ideal for use with combinations of oils and water-soluble herbicide combinations when a pesticide label requests the use of a HSOC adjuvant. Hybrid contains Pinolene®, which minimizes drying out of the herbicide deposit, lengthens the time over which herbicides can be absorbed and reduces wash off and ultraviolet (UV) degradation of herbicides, improving herbicide performance.",
