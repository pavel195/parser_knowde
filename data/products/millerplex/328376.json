    "description": "Nu-Film-17® is a superior deposition, sticker, and extender adjuvant with non-ionic properties based on proprietary Miller technology containing Pinolene. Once applied, Nu-Film-17 begins to polymerize, on the leaf surface, forming a soft elastic film. This film reduces the effects of rainfall erosion, volatility, and ultraviolet (UV) degradation on agrochemical spray deposits. Nu-Film-17 maximizes the effective life of an agrochemical after application by encapsulating and holding the pesticide on the crop surface. Miller adjuvants are essential for the performance of most conventional pesticides and are helping to shift use to more environmentally friendly treatment options such as biological pesticides and preventative options.",
