    "description": "Acti-Min® RG is a high quality, low residue, air floated sedimentary hard kaolin clay. Strict attention to production and quality control assures a high degree of product uniformity. Acti-Min RG is classified to a very low 325 mesh residue, making it suitable for any customers who may be sensitive to fine, non-kaolin residue.\r\n\r\n\r\nHard Clays are very fine in their natural particle size. They provide high modules, tensile strength, abrasion resistance, green strength and stiffness to elasometric compounds.\r\n",
