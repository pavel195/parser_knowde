    "description": "Crown Clay is a high quality, air float, sedimentary, hard kaolin clay. Strict attention to production and quality control assures a high degree of product uniformity. Hard clays are very fine in their natural particle size. This limits how much hard clay can be incorporated into a rubber com-pound. Typical loading levels range from 20 to 150 phr. Hard clay provides high modulus, tensile strength, abrasion re-sistance, green strength and provides stiffness to elastomeric compounds.\r\n",
