    "description": "MiraPatch RM1 is a two-component, polymer-modified, cementitious, trowel-grade concrete repair mortar and high performance underlayment for Miracote and other subsequent finished flooring installations. Designed primarily for horizontal applications, MiraPatch RM1 can be applied from near feather up to 3/4” in thickness. It can also be used in vertical and overhead applications when repair methods using formwork are being utilized. For applications greater than 3/4” in depth, extend MiraPatch RM1 with coarse ¼” (3/4” to 1”) or 3/8” (&gt;1”) clean aggregate to produce MiraPatch RM1 concrete which will enhance dimensional stability.",
