    "description": "SW-244 is a clear penetrating, breathable water repellent designed for the protection of exterior above-grade concrete, brick masonry, and some natural stones from the damage caused by water intrusion. It penetrates the surface and bonds chemically to the substrate, resulting in permanent attachment of the water repellent molecule. SW-244 is not a coating and as a result will not discolor or change the surface appearance in any way.",
