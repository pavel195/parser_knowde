    "description": "SILANE WB CONCENTRATE™ is a VOC compliant modified silane water repellent concentrate designed for dilution with fresh potable water at the jobsite. When diluted, SILANE WB CONCENTRATE™ may be applied to vertical and horizontal, dense and porous masonry surfaces. SILANE WB CONCENTRATE™ is solvent free and VOC compliant. Prepared solutions react with the silica in concrete and masonry in the presence of ultraviolet light and atmospheric moisture. This reaction forms strong permanent bonds beneath the surface and creates a hydrophobic zone that prevents water molecules from penetrating, while allowing free migration of water vapors. The chemical bonds formed in this process become an integral part of the substrate and provide long-term water repellent protection.",
