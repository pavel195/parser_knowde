    "description": "Monochem 300 is a single component, liquid applied, water-based elastomeric urethane waterproofing base membrane. Monochem 300 can be used as part of an elastomeric system designed to expand and contract with normal structural movements. It provides a thick monolithic film that is water-tight. This system will not soften in heat or become brittle in the cold. Monochem 300 is designed for use on wood, concrete, and masonry to provide a waterproof elastomeric base membrane. It can also be applied as a below grade waterproofing coating.",
