    "description": "Moisture Vapor Barrier is a two component, 100% solids, solvent free epoxy primer designed for superior moisture vapor transmission control. Moisture Vapor Barrier can eliminate the risk of coating failure due to high moisture vapor emissions. It is suitable for concrete and a variety floor coverings such as vinyl, tiles, sheeting, carpet, hardwood, and as a primer for urethanes, epoxies and traffic membranes. It is an ideal primer for damp areas, high moisture emitting surfaces and for below grade applications.",
