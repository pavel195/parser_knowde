    "description": "KetoseSweet+™ Powder 1lb has allulose — a rare natural sugar found in maple syrup, figs and raisins — and is a safe, non-caloric, non-glycemic sweetener. With just 5% of the calories of regular sugar, it delivers familiar taste and texture without affecting blood sugar levels. Free of strange aftertaste, bitterness, and potential health concerns of artificial sweeteners, KetoseSweet+ Powder doesn’t impact blood sugar levels. It's safe for those following a low-sugar diet, plus allulose has been shown to enhance fat metabolism and it may help with maintaining a healthy body weight.",
