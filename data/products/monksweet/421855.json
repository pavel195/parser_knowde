A mainstay for centuries in regions around the world, stevia is an all-natural high intensity sweetener, derived from the stevia leaf.  Using a clean water process to extract the sweetest part of the leaf, containing the most potent steviol glycosides, yields a high intensity sweetener that is 250-300 times sweeter than table sugar.  A little goes a very long way. 100% pure, clean stevia extract in a fine powder, no fillers or additives.  With a minimum 95% steviol glycosides and minimum 98% Reb A, SteviaSweet RA98 is designed specifically for manufacturers.",
