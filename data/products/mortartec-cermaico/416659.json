    "description": "Mortartec Silicate™ DS is an industrial-grade repair mortar designed for dry shotcrete only applications to repair deteriorated concrete, where an early cure, high-density overlay is required. The material is a blend of Portland cement, graded silica sand, fibers and silica fume- incorporating corrosion and rust inhibitors. The mortar is spray applied, typically from ½” to 4” in depth (overhead and vertically) with incredible adhesion. Uses include repairing concrete walls, ceilings, brick, etc. Mortartec Silicate DS provides an extremely dense matrix and will accept coatings at earlier ages than typical Portland cement repair products.",
