    "description": "MP Slow™ is a slow rebound urethane foam cushions fragile foot tissues. In fact, it's a go-to orthosis material for wound care, surgery and injured patients. Like memory foam, MP SLOW urethane foam has a slow recovery (slow rebound). The slow recovery is preferable when you want the foam to conform to the wearer like a cast or bandage. And like a bandage, MP SLOW's open cell matrix breathes, allowing tissues to stay dry and cool.",
