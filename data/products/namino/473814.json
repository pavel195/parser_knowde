    "description": "Daesang America, Inc. L-Arginine 98.5% (Feed) is produced by microbial fermentation and is an essential amino acid for mammals, poultry, and fish. Unlike mammals, poultry lack the urea cycle to biosynthesize L-arginine, so they must obtain it through their diet. It has a variety of metabolic functions and is key to protein synthesis, as well as aiding in improving blood circulation.Please find more information on https://ingredient.daesang.com/s/?language=en_US",
