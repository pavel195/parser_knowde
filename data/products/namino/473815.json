    "description": "Daesang America, Inc. L-Arginine 98.5% (Food) is produced through microbial fermentation. It is an essential amino acid for infant development and is required by some adults who have not yet acquired a sufficient capacity for in vivo synthesis. As a result, they need to obtain L-arginine through diet. It is also a key component of protein synthesis and helps improve blood circulation. Additionally, due to its natural moisturizing ability, L-arginine is used in parenteral and enteral nutrition.Please find more information on https://ingredient.daesang.com/s/?language=en_US",
