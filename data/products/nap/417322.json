    "description": "Broombush (Melaleuca uncinata) is a plant is a plant in the paperbark family native to southern Australia. It is harvested from the wild and grown in plantations for broombush fencing and is now also being cultivated for its essential oil. A multi-stemmed evergreen shrub usually less than 2 m, it has spreading or ascending leaves, 19–56 mm (0.75–2.20 in) long and 0.8–1.2 mm (0.031–0.047 in) wide, linear in shape, almost circular in cross-section, and tapering to a distinctly curved hook. The leaves have large oil glands along their edges. Its flowers are white, cream or yellow, and are attractive to birds. It grows in warm temperate and semi-arid areas in sandy soils that are acidic to alkaline. With a zesty yet sweet aroma, this steam distilled oil has a complex variety of uses based on the individual chemotype of the batch of oil, but in general it is valued for its antiseptic, antifungal, insect repellent and expectorant properties.",
