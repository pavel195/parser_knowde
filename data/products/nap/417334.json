    "description": "There are two different varieties of chamomile you may come across; Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile or Anthemis nobilis) and German chamomile (Matricaria recutita or Chamomilla recutita) The two plants are slightly different in appearance. In addition, the chemical composition of their active ingredients differs slightly. Research has been done on both strains and the active ingredient most researched is chamazulene which is higher in German chamomile. German Chamomile (Matricaria recutica) is native to central and northern Europe. The herb usually grows near populated areas; it is annual, strongly aromatic, and has tall, hairless, erect, branching stems, with delicate feathery leaves and simple daisy-like white flowers on single stems. The flowers are smaller than those of Roman Chamomile. Matricaria Recutita Flower Oil is the essential oil distilled from the flowers of the plant which are dried prior to distillation. Although commonly known as 'German Chamomile Oil' it is in fact not grown in Germany, but in years past, large volumes grown in Hungary were sent to Germany for distillation.",
