    "description": "Conventional or organic available Patchouli Oil (Pogostemon cablin), sometimes called the scent of the sixties, has a musky, earthy, exotic aroma. Native to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, Patchouli is now cultivated in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. The oil is widely used as a fragrance in India and as an insect repellent. Patchouli is used in herbal medicine in Asia as an aphrodisiac, antidepressant and antiseptic. It is also used for headaches and fever. Its aphrodisiac effects come from it having a very similar molecular structure to human pheromones. Patchouli essential oil is often used in aromatherapy to treat skin complaints. It is thought to have a regenerative effect on skin tone and to help clear conditions such as eczema and acne. The oil may also be used for varicose veins, acne, cold sores, skin irritations, prophylactic, fungicidal and hemorrhoids. It is interesting to note that Patchouli improves with age and that the aged product is what is often preferred over the freshly harvested",
