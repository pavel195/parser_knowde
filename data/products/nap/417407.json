It boasts powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-microbial properties and is rich in essential fatty acids and Vitamin E. Originally cultivated around Iran and India, the fruit was brought to Egypt and revered by the Egyptians as early as 1600BC as an important food source and for its medicinal properties. It is now widely grown around the Mediterranean and the Middle East. This oil is red to yellow/golden color with a distinct subtle smell. Pomegranate Seed Oil is extremely nutritious and rich which makes it a great ingredient for skin, hair and body products.",
