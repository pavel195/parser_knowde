    "description": "This Refined Rosehip oil has a light yellow color and is very lightly scented, almost odorless. Refined oils have been filtered to remove color and odor and are often referred to as Cosmetic grade as they are favored in the making of cosmetic products as the color and smell of Virgin oils can interfere with other ingredients. Some say refined oils have impurities removed, this is true in a sense as they typically have longer shelf life than Virgin oils. Rosehip oil has been cold-pressed from the crushed fruit and seeds of a certain variety of wild rose plant, specifically rosa canina, endemic to Chile. After the rose petals have dropped the distinctive red fruit is harvested. The fruit is also called the hip, hence the name Rosehip. Rosehip oil is high in vitamins such as vitamin C and A, a rich source of antioxidants and essential fatty acids. These vitamins can help reduce signs of skin aging and may help prevent fine lines. This oil also contains antioxidants like tocopherol and carotenoids that have been known to protect the skin and is also rich in anti-inflammatory acids that may help soothe redness and irritation.",
