    "description": "Naturall-Le™ Soy Lecithin Liquid is generally used as an emulsifier. It is 100% pure lecithin, non-modified, and non-fractioned. Lecithin Liquid is a surface-active agent with unique properties, derived from vegetable oilseed sources. It can modify the boundary layers between many types of substances. In the presence of two immiscible liquid phases, lecithin reduces the surface tension and acts as an emulsifier. Along with emulsification, it also adds value to the nutrition of the product being rich in phospholipids.",
