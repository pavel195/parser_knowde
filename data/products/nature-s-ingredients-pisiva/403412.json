    "description": "Ortiva® Rice Protein 80% is an outstanding plant-based alternative to animal and dairy based proteins. It is gluten free, hypoallergenic and easily digestible. Brown rice is an excellent source of protein. The use of organic rice proteins in sports &amp; energy nutrition products is due to 37% of the total protein being comprised of essential amino acids and 18% as branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), which are essential for athletes and bodybuilders. Research shows that rice protein matches the effectiveness of whey protein for increasing lean body mass, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, power, strength, and exercise recovery.\r\n",
