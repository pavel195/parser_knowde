    "description": "EPDM 80 B WRAS R1 [E6392] is an EPDM elastomer with good physical properties &amp; meets the requirements of BS 6920-1:2000 and BS EN681-1 WA 70.EPDM rubber has excellent heat, ozone and chemical resistance propertiesEPDM also has good physical properties and is resistant to polar fluidsLow-temperature properties require the polymer to be amorphous and low on ethylene (speak to the expert)Good electrical properties require high ethylene to facilitate high doses of inert mineral fillers to give good electrical resistanceEPDM rubber can be compounded to provide excellent electrical resistance",
