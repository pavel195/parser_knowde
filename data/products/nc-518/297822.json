    "description": "NC-518™ is a novel calcium that increased bone density in a Phase I and Phase II human clinical study by 2.2% over 4 months. The science is based on a unique, patented technology – the world’s first and only technology, in fact that can pulverize Calcium into two-digit, micronized powder (0.03 micro - 30 nanometers]) without changing the integrity of the original nutrients. Lab and human tests revealed significant bioavailability never seen before in traditional Calcium. This is called Laser Micronization.",
