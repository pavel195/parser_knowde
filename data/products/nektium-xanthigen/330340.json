We standardize our Rhodiolife速to two different grades of rosavins and salidroside. We studied Rhodiolife速 in both in vitro, in vivo and in human trials and showed a significant increase of brain activity, a reduction of anxiety and stress and improved muscle protection and recovery after excercise.",
