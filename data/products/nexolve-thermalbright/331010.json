    "description": "Thermalbright® Polyimide is a High performance white polyimide \nThermalbright® Polyimide is a high performance white polyimide with wide ranging uses in display applications, electrical insulators, composites, industrial tapes, space structures, and many others. Thermalbright® Polyimide is useful in thermal control applications requiring low absorptivity, high emissivity, UV stability, and high temperature colorfastness. Thermalbright® Polyimide exhibits high optical density and hiding, making it an excellent high temperature white paint replacement material. Thermalbright® Polyimide is available in two grades: Thermalbright® C for Electrostatic Dissipative (ESD) applications, and Thermalbright® N for applications that require electrical insulation. Thermalbright® Polyimide is available as a liquid casting resin or film product.",
