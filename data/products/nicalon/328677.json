    "description": "Nicalon™ SiC Fiber is a multi-filament silicon carbide-type fiber manufactured by NGS Advanced Fibers Co., Ltd. of Japan. The fiber is homogeneously composed of ultra-fine beta-SiC crystallites and an amorphous mixture of silicon, carbon, and oxygen. The fiber has excellent strength and modulus properties for ceramic fibers, and retains its properties at high temperatures. NICALON™ is highly resistant to oxidation and chemical attack.",
