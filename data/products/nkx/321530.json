    "description": "NKX-190 is a very small particle size aqueous pU (from the order of nano dispersion) developed to compose tops on superficial voltage substrates. It has excellent finish and adherence allowing its compatibility with many other resins being numerous its possibilities of application. Being your very soft and non-sticky movie serves to \"regulate\" the hardness of other harder varnishes such as NKx 160, 150 or 180. In textile applications lends to blends with acrylics providing very soft touches. In the scanning folders, it can be combined with acrylic resins (10 and 20%) to improve the elasticity and dimensional stability of the film and avoid crazing",
