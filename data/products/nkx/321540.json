    "description": "NKX 299 is a self-contained power presenting film with great transparency and adhesion. The healing of this resin occurs at room temperature and will be complete within five days, where it will reach its best properties. Your film features excellent water and chemical resistance properties, higher than non-reticulable conventional resins. It is very good for coating flexible or non-adhering synthetic substrates as PVC or other elastomeric coating to compose varnish or topcoat, where a higher performance is desired without addiculty (\"catalysts\").",
