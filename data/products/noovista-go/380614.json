    "description": "Loxidan products show significant synergistic effects, as they contain antioxidants with different spectrums of activity, which complement each other in their effects. By combining primary and secondary antioxidants, fewer antioxidants are needed overall to achieve the same, if not better, effectiveness. This makes Loxidan more effective and versatile, both directly in compound feed and in its preliminary stages.",
