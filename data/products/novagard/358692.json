    "description": "Novagard® G635 is an amorphous fumed silica thickened, methyl-diphenyl polysiloxane based compound. The very broad operating temperature range typical of phenyl-modified silicone fluids characterizes Novagard® G635. The product retains its superior lubricity and dielectric character in temperature extremes from as low as –57°C to as high as 200°C.",
