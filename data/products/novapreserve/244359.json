    "description": "Novasolve EHIN is used as an emollient in skin care and may be used as a resin plasticizer for hair styling resins. Its branched nature imparts a low-viscosity and low freeze point, making it useful for reducing the tackiness of heavier oils, and so enhancing finished product feel (making it softer, drier, and/or less oily).",
