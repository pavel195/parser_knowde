    "description": "Noxtat SDB™ acrylic sheets are coated with a transparent metal/plastic material that will permanently prevent formation of static electricity on the surface. The surface has excellent mar and abrasion resistance, resistance to charge generation, and superior static decay characteristics and cannot be tribocharged. The product displays excellent control of both electrostatic discharge (ESD) and particulate attraction. Their permanent characteristics are not affected by humidity. They are intended for use in fabricated parts as well as panels. They are flexible for heat bending and is clear and hard for panel applications.",
