    "description": "Geogard Ultra® is a patented, synergistic blend consisting of Gluconolactone (polyhydroxy acid or PHA) and Sodium Benzoate. The synergy between these two ingredients, Gluconolactone and Sodium Benzoate, makes this preservative unique, allowing for its broad spectrum efficacy.Organic acids often require a co-preservative or additional booster to provide an optimal performance, as they are too weak on their own. In this blend, the Gluconolactone works in conjunction with the sodium benzoate to perform as an efficient preservative booster that is also non-GMO. Geogard Ultra®’s Gluconolactone works by slowly releasing Gluconic Acid over time, which helps contribute to the preservation effect.INCI Name: Gluconolactone (CAS: 90-80-2), Sodium Benzoate (CAS: 532-32-1) and Calcium Gluconate (CAS: 299-28-5)Key Benefits of Geogard Ultra®:Wide range of global regulatory acceptanceBroad spectrum activityECOCERT/COSMOS accepted, NATRUE and Soil Association approvedWide applicability/compatibilityEasy to formulateAdded skin moisturization benefitApplications Include:Beauty &amp; CareAP/DeoBaby CareBath &amp; ShowerColor CosmeticsHair CareOral CareSkin CareSun CarePersonal HygieneHand HygieneOther Personal Hygiene ApplicationsWipes, Tissue &amp; TowelLabeling Claims of Geogard Ultra®:Cruelty-FreeEnvironmentally FriendlyHalalNaturalNaturally DerivedNon-GMOOrganicSustainable",
