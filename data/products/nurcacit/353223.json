    "description": "Nurcacit MBT PDR can be used as a fast, non-staining accelerator for both dry rubber and latex applications. Low temperature curing can be achieved by the use of Nurcacit TMTD/TETD or Nurcacit DPG as secondary accelerators. Nurcacit MBT confers excellent aging characteristics to vulcanizates.",
