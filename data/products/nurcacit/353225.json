    "description": "Nurcacit ZMBT PDR finds its main application in latex where it is used as a primary accelerator in combination with ZDMC or ZDEC. Latex films cured with ZMBT have a markedly higher modulus. Furthermore a better compression set resistance in latex foam can be achieved, without increasing the cure time. ZMBT does not destabilize latex formulations. In dry rubber applications, the performance of ZMBT is almost similar to MBT with slight scorch improvement.",
