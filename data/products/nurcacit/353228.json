    "description": "Nurcacit TBBS PDR provides fast cure and high modules development in NR SBR BR and blends. Normally used alone or with small quantities of ultra accelerators in tire compounds or industrial rubber products. Can be used to effectively replace MBTS/DPG systems TBBS may give equal modulus to CBS or MBS when used as a 10% lower level.",
