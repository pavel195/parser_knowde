    "description": "BGF-Immune®1,3-Beta-Glucan supports healthy immune function by working on the cells of the innate immune defense system to mobilize a complex set of immune defense mechanisms. This ultimately enhances the body's immune response to promote overall health and wellness. General research shows that immune function receptor bindings are specific to 1,3 linkages. Unlike other sources of Beta-Glucan from barley, oats, mushrooms and yeast that report a combined total of (1,3 &amp; 1,4) or (1,3 &amp; 1,6) Beta-Glucans, BGF-Immune® contains high purity 1,3 linkages with virtually no 1,4 or 1,6 linkages. It is the 1,3 linkage that is specifically associated with immune health.",
