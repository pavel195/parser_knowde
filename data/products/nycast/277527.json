    "description": "Nycast速 Nyloil速MDX Gray provides superior machinability, performance, and durability compared to other plastic and traditional bearing materials. Three grades of NYLOIL are available to fit the most demanding applications: original green NYLOIL for most bearing applications; food-grade, Natural NYLOIL-FG for direct contact with food, and MoS2 filledNYLOIL-MDX with slightly higher compressive load capabilities than original NYLOIL. The incorporation of an oil lubricant package into the nylon matrix provides significant advantages over other bearing materials: NYLOIL-MDX is formulated with Molybdenum Disulfide filler, which promotes higher crystallinity in the cast polymer, in addition to the oil lubricant package. This yields a bearing material with more consistent intermolecular structure and generally a narrower distribution within the range of physical property values, while retaining the advanced friction properties of unfilled NYLOIL.",
