    "description": "Nycast® CP 6/12 has proven itself in many applications that require an extra degree of toughness. A copolymer of Caprolactam and Laurinlactam, NYCAST CP was specifically developed for use in ball valve seats in the oil and gas industry. This durable material provides an economical, high-performance bridge between NYCAST 6 and NYCAST 12 formulations. NYCAST CP has a higher elongation, superior dimensional stability and a safety yellow color. Because of this, it has found itself a superior choice for wobbler box inserts and coupling boxes in the cold rolling steel industry as well as mandrel covers used in paper tube manufacturing plants.",
