    "description": "Nycast® 12 remain virtually unaffected in a wide range of environments. NYCAST 12 offers superior performance in applications where dimensional stability, chemical resistance, dielectrics, abrasion resistance and impact strength are important factors. In wet or dry environments, indoor or outdoor, the low deformation and superior fatigue resistance properties of NYCAST 12 delivers unmatched performance in many high-speed wheel and roller applications. This material is also well-suited to use for power transmission components in material handling and transportation environments, as well as in structural and enclosure elements in sensitive electronic and manufacturing equipment. Cast Nylons Limited is the only producer of cast nylon 12 in North America.",
