    "description": "NYLATECH® SL contains a proprietary solid lubricant, which offers a low coefficient of friction with superior wear resistance. It is used for dynamic applications where external lubrication is difficult or impossible. Providing in excess of 5 times longer part life than other lubricated materials, it offers significant savings in machine maintenance and down time costs. As well, it provides added assurance of part life in friction applications where other cast nylons may fail.",
