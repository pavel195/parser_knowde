    "description": "MECHETEC® Delrin® (polyoxy-methylene) offers design engineers a superior blend of strength, stiffness, lubricity, and dimensional stability. These properties, along with inherent machining ease, have made MECHETEC® Delrin® one of the most widely used engineering grade thermoplastics. To meet specific application configurations and to maximize production efficiencies, Polymer Industries offers a broad array of MECHETEC® Delrin® stock shapes. These materials include both homopolymer unfilled grades as well as PTFE-filled grades for enhanced wear resistance and DE-588 options for military applications. Formally known as Unital Delrin.
