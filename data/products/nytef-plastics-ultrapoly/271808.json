    "description": "MECHETEC® PPO (blend of polyphenylene oxide and styrene) is an amorphous thermoplastic that offers a superior blend of physical strength, flame resistance, and outstanding electrical properties. Unlike many amorphous materials that tend to steadily lose strength as temperatures increase, MECHETEC® PPO maintains its high stiffness to temperatures in excess of 200°F. In addition, it’s low moisture absorption and low coefficient of thermal expansion contribute to it being one of the most dimensionally stable materials available. MECHETEC® PPO has an excellent V-0 UL-94 flame rating at thicknesses of 0.24\" and over. For applications that require improved strength and stiffness, 30% glass fiber filled is available. Formally known as Uninor PPO.",
