    "description": "The docking or berthing of a ship puts an enormous pressure and friction transferred between the ship and the shore fixtures. This can lead to large scale damage and deterioration to the shore fixtures. Traditionally, docks have used rubber and timber systems to provide a barrier between the ship and the dock. However, timber quickly deteriorates in the harsh marine climate while rubber is prone to tearing and catastrophic failure in this application. POLYSLICK® PILE GUARDS have excellent impact and abrasion resistance, and a low coefficient of friction, which is proven to be an ideal material in dock applications. The material is ideally suited to harsh marine environments due to its almost zero moisture absorption and chemical resistance to saltwater. The material’s extremely high molecular weight essentially holds the material together during the extreme force transfers between the ship and dock.",
