    "description": "Ultra Non-Skid® technology initially developed for the United States Navy has been scaled down for commercial use. New to the Ultra Non-Skid® family is Luns permanent non-skid sheet. These non-skid technologies are a direct replacement for non-skid tapes and paints for industrial applications. The product has a wear and impact resistant baseplate of ultra high molecular polyethylene (UHMW-PE). The surface of the sheet is covered with anti-skid material comprised of slag.",
