    "description": "Aquamin is a concentrated biostimulant in powder formulation which is ideal for fertigation or for customized blending. It has been shown to improve the productivity of the plant’s metabolism for healthier, more resilient growth throughout a plant’s life cycle, plus added support for the more delicate phases. It is rapidly absorbed to strengthen cell walls, “prime” plants for future stress, and boost nutrient uptake and use efficiency.",
