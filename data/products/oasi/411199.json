    "description": "Auxym is created using Plant Stimulating Peptides, extracts from tropical plants, and other natural ingredients that reliably improve the overall quality of the plant, flower, and fruit, while protecting the plant from pests, shock, and drought. It is unique in that it actively works to strengthen the plant during the most critical phases (growth of sprouts and the enlargement of fruits), so applying throughout the flowering and production cycle will result in a higher quantity of flowers, more high-quality fruits, and a healthier plant overall.",
