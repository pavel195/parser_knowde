    "description": "Cerbero 11-22-30 + 2 MgO is an NPK water-soluble fertilizer featuring a very high degree of solubility, purity and the absence of chlorine and sodium. The 1:2:3 NPK ratio makes this product particularly suitable for the fertilization of crops during blossoming and fruit bearing phases. Phosphorus and potassium supplied by fertigation in these phases improve plant productivity and fruit quality (faster ripening, increased sugar content, improved color).",
