Immediately after the harvest the olives are pressed in traditional oil mills. The olive water, rich in polyphenols, that is separated from the olive oil is extracted and spray dried. Olivex™ is available as a spray-dried powder that is standardized for tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, using maltodextrin as the carrier substance.",
