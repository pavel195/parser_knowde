    "description": "Trans-Resveratrol™ is derived naturally from the Japanese Knotweed plant and has much higher bioavailability than that of chemically derived trans resveratrol. Unlike grapes, Knotweed grows in the wild and contains a higher concentration of trans-resveratrol; grape resveratrol is only available in purities of up to 5%-8%. This “natural fountain of youth” contains anti-aging and anti-cancer antioxidants*. It is also excellent for the cardiovascular system and helps improve protection against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.",
