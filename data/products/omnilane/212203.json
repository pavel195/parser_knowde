    "description": "Omnilane OC 1005 cycloaliphatic epoxide is miscible with a wide range of organic solvents, including acetone, ethanol, and benzene. It’s low viscosity and good fluidity make it suitable for use in bulk manufacturing. The long term stability at ambient temperature is very good. It will react in the presence of acid anhydride curing agents at higher temperature. Omnilane OC 1005 when cured is suitable for use at high temperatures between 200 - 250°C for long periods.",
