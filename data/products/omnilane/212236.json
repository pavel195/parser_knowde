    "description": "Omnirad 819 is a versatile photoinitiator for radical polymerization of unsaturated resins upon UV light exposure. It is especially suitable for white pigmented Formulations, the curing of glass-fiber-reinforced polyester/styrene systems and for clear coats for outdoor use in combinations with light stabilizers. Thick section curing is also possible with this photoinitiator.",
