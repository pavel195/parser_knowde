    "description": "OPTIM® R-656 is a maleic anhydride modified elastomeric resin in granular form. The grafted maleic anhydride groups on otherwise poyolefinic chains make it compatible with other mineral or polar fillers and polymers. Its high maleic anhydride content makes it suitable for compatibilization of highly filled polymer compounds. It can be processed using conventional plastics compounding equipment. Unique properties of this material provide many possibilities of extending base polymer properties, including wettablity and toughening.",
