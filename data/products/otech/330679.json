    "description": "OTech Platinum LA731 is the world’s first platinum particle-free conductive ink that metallizes into high surface area platinum catalytic structures. This form of platinum structure has an application in fuel cells and batteries. OrelTech’s unique process allows the deposition of highly conductive thin metallic films. The thin layers undergo short development using cold plasma treatment resulting in a fine metal structure. OrelTech’s technology enables the deposition of the ink with many different methods and on various substrates, from plastics to fabrics. OTech inks do not contain nanoparticles, and as such enable the material economy of precious metals while being significantly more environmentally friendly than the existing alternatives on the market.",
