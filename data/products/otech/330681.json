    "description": "OTech T is a unique silver particle-free conductive ink developed specially for the printing of silver layers with &gt;80% transparency. It is ideal for printing of (flexible) transparent electronics like touchscreens, OLEDs or solar cells.OrelTech’s unique process allows the deposition of highly conductive thin metallic films. The thin layers undergo short development using cold plasma treatment resulting in a fine metal structure. OrelTech’s technology enables the deposition of the ink with many different methods and on various substrates, from plastics to fabrics. OTech inks do not contain nanoparticles, and as such enable the material economy of precious metals while being significantly more environmentally friendly than the existing alternatives on the market.Read an article on the OLED prototype constructed with OTech T published in Flexible and Printed Electronics: https://doi.org/10.1088/2058-8585/abe604",
