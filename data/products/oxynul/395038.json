    "description": "J-Cut NCL-18 is a moderate to heavy duty dual purpose cutting oil developed to machine a wide variety of metals without the need for chlorinated additives. The extreme pressure lubricants are balanced to provide ease of cut with minimal tool wear. An effective anti-mist additive is incorporated into the J-Cut NCL-18 to reduce misting of the cutting oil during high speed machining operations.",
