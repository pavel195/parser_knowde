    "description": "Food-grade synthetic esters emulsified in water. P-80速 Emulsion IFC is a water-based product, specially formulated to provide temporary lubrication that makes rubber easy to install, remove, or otherwise manipulate. P-80速 Emulsion provides a high degree of lubricity when wet, but because it does not contain silicone or other persistent ingredients, once dry, the slipping action goes away. P-80速 Emulsion is compatible with most metals, plastics, and natural and synthetic elastomers.",
