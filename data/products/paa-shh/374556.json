    "description": "PAA-SHH速 PAA-SHH速 (Phosphoric Acid Anodized-Showa Hexagonal Honeycomb) 1/8-5052-001 is an aerospace grade 5052 aluminum honeycomb materials produced from phosphoric acid anodized aluminum sheets. Phosphoric acid anodize gives an excellent corrosion resistance to aluminum alloy, and the surface treatment system with a corrosion prohibited primer provide the greatest bondability and fatigue strength under critical conditions such as hot &amp; wet condition. PAA-SHH is available in a wide selection of cell sizes and foil thickness.",
