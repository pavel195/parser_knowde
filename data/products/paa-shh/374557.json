    "description": "PAA-SDFH速 PAA-SDFH速 (Phosphoric Acid Anodized-Showa Double Flexible Honeycomb) 4.8-5052-47 is an aerospace grade 5052 aluminum honeycomb materials produced from phosphoric acid anodized aluminum sheets. Phosphoric acid anodize gives an excellent corrosion resistance to aluminum alloy, and the surface treatment system with a corrosion prohibited primer provide the greatest bondability and fatigue strength under critical conditions such as hot &amp; wet condition. PAA-SDFH is available in two selections of core density and foil thickness.",
