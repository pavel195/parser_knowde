    "description": "PAA-SFH速 PAA-SFH速 (Phosphoric Acid Anodized-Showa Flexible Honeycomb) 3.1-5052-19 is an aerospace grade 5052 aluminum honeycomb materials produced from phosphoric acid anodized aluminum sheets. Phosphoric acid anodize gives an excellent corrosion resistance to aluminum alloy, and the surface treatment system with a corrosion prohibited primer provide the greatest bondability and fatigue strength under critical conditions such as hot &amp; wet condition.",
