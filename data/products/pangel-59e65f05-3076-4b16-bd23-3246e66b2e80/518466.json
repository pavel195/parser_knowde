    "description": "Epoxycure - EC422 is a modified cycloaliphatic amine adduct designed for use as an ambient temperature hardener with liquid epoxy resins. Its light color, low viscosity, and moisture insensitivity have made it the curing agent of choice in a wide variety of 100% solid coatings. It performs exceptionally well in self-leveling floor mortars and any casting and laminating applications where excellent flow and leveling properties are desired. Additionally, it is suitable for general civil engineering applications such as grouts, adhesives, and patching compounds where high filler loadings are needed. The product exhibits good chemical and blush resistance and demonstrates good adhesion to a variety of substrates.",
