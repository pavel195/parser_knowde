    "description": "PAR Group Peek Carbon Filled Sheet maintains all the significant benefits of standard PEEK material such as excellent chemical and radiation resistance, high dimensional stability and high resistance to creep. The carbon fiber reinforcement helps to improve the wear properties of the material as they are typically less abrasive than the fibers used in the glass filled alternative. Carbon filled PEEK sheet is also flame retardant, self-extinguishing and electrically conductive, making for an extremely versatile material.",
