    "description": "PAR Group Nylon 6 MoS2 Extruded Sheet offers increased load bearing and wear resistance, whilst maintaining the impact and fatigue resistance of standard nylon grades. It is self-lubricating, electrically insulating and has a high fatigue resistance. We also manufacture our own brand of Corromide® CMF (Nylon 6 Sheet - MoS2 Filled Cast) in sheets, rods and tubes. Our MoS2 Filled Cast Nylon 6 is available in greater sheet thicknesses and offers a higher temperature rating compared to MoS2 Filled Extruded Nylon 6. Nylon 6 Sheet - MoS2 Filled Extruded is available to buy online at PAR Direct by clicking the link above.",
