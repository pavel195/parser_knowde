    "description": "PAR Group Nylon 6 Flame Retardant Sheet retains the same mechanical properties of regular nylon 6 while adding the benefit of being flame retardant. It has been tested to the new EU rail vehicle standard (DIN EN 45545-2:2013) and is rated to UL94 V-0. It's low density also provides significant weight benefits in comparison to other materials such as steel.",
