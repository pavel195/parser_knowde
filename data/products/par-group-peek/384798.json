    "description": "Nylon 66 sheet offers a higher mechanical strength, stiffness, heat and wear resistance than nylon 6. It also has a better creep resistance but lower impact strength and is approved for food contact. Nylon 66 benefits over Nylon 6 extruded: Higher temperature rating, lower impact strength and mechanical damping. Higher wear resistance and easier to machine.",
