    "description": "PAR Group Peek Metal Detectable Sheet is an ideal solution for machined components which are subject to multiple sterilizations, such as CIP (cleaning in place) and SIP (sterilization in place) applications. It is suitable for food approved components which require increased stiffness without the need for reinforcement. It contains very fine material additives making it detectable to most metal detector scanning equipment. Our blue metal detectable PEEK also contains a solid lubricant which provides better sliding properties over standard PEEK products.",
