    "description": "Clin-Cat 810 Cationic Corn Starch #028810 is specifically prepared to produce a superior starch for the internal sizing of paper. This product can improve the retention of fillers such as titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, and clay. It can also improve the retention of fine fibers and sheet strength (i.e., burst strength and Scott bond). This cationic corn starch is derivatized using a quaternary amine. Since its cationic charge is observed over a wide pH range, it can be suitable for either acidic or alkaline papermaking systems.",
