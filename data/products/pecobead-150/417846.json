    "description": "RM-1012™ is a Low End Rheological Modifier is a high efficiency viscosity modifier/booster for all invert fluids, including synthetics RM-1012™ enhances rheology and stability of both invert and all-oil drilling fluids, with an emphasis on low end rheology increase. This allows LEM to provide excellent anti-settling properties for stored fluids and low end modification for fluids requiring low shear viscosity.",
