    "description": "Phoenix Chemical offers sustainable partially and fully hydrogenated BIOGEL 100% vegetable butters. They are soft pastes that melt at skin temperature, spread easily and are very emollient and non-greasy. As can be seen from the attached solubility table, they are generally miscible in oils, silicones, and esters. They can be liquefied with vegetablebased esters such as PELEMOL P-810 (Propanediol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate) to form liquid 100% vegetable-based emollients. The butters can be emulsified with PELEMOL P-1263 (Polyglyceryl-10 Hexaoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate) to form w/o emulsions which can invert to o/w as the water phase increases. Other useful emulsifiers to be considered are PELEMOL GMB (Glyceryl Behenate), and PELEMOL GMR (Glyceryl Ricinoleate).",
