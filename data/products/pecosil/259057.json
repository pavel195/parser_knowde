    "description": "PECOSIL® DDL is the diester resulting from the esterification of Dimethiconol and Lactic Acid. It is a 100% active liquid that spreads easily on skin leaving the skin with a silicone-like, silky soft “feel”. In addition to its use in skin creams and lotions its use is also clearly indicated in haircare products for conditioning and manageability as well as in lipstick and makeup products. It is postulated that enzymes found in the skin’s epidermis will hydrolyze esters and free up the corresponding alpha-hydroxyl acid so it may perform its exfoliating affect. PECOSIL® DDL not only provides moisturization through a semi-occlusive barrier effect, but also delivers the alpha-hydroxyl acid (lactic acid) via a slow release owing to the skin’s own natural esterase.",
