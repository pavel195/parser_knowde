    "description": "PELEMOL® EC is composed of the ethyl esters of Canola Oil acids. It is a clear, 100% vegetable derived and 100% active liquid. Surprisingly, PELEMOL® EC exhibits a distinct silicone-like “feel” on skin and, in particular, much like cyclomethicone D5 and low viscosity silicone fluids. Moreover, the solubility profiles for PELEMOL® EC versus cyclomethicone D5 are virtually identical. This suggests ease of formulation and perhaps one-to-one replacement. The refractive indexes for cyclomethicone D5 (1.397) and PELEMOL® EC (1.461) suggest that PELEMOL® EC will provide enhanced sheen in formulations. Use levels can range from 2 – 20%.",
