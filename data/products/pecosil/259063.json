    "description": "PELEMOL® 9512 is the ester formed by the reaction of Isoamyl Alcohol and Lauric Acid; it is 100% vegetable derived and 100% active. PELEMOL® 9512 has sensorial properties similar to silicone and its broad solubility range suggests it can be used as a silicone replacement. It adds a silky feel to fragrances and acts as a skin conditioning agent, leaving skin with a dry, soft feel. It also enhances the spreadability of pigments where it imparts a silicone-like feel.",
