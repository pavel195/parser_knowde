    "description": "PEL-PHOS™ LP-300 Is a low-foaming aromatic phosphate ester with hydrotrope properties. It is a highly efficient agent for coupling nonionic surfactants into built hard surface cleaners. It is useful for cleaning formulations intended for metal & bottle-washing. When incorporated into metal cutting formulations, PEL-PHOS™ LP-300 provides extreme pressure lubricity due to its phosphate functionality.",
