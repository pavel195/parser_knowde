Excellent surface tension reducer, it can boost foam quantity and stability in a multitude of personal care applications. It provides additional benefits such as moisturizing, emollience and a soft silky feel on hair and skin. It may also be used as a reagent to modify polymeric systems by virtue of its two primary hydroxyls. In these systems, it provides the typical benefits of silicones that include slip, mar resistance, anti-blocking, softness and improved temperature stability to the finish polymer.",
