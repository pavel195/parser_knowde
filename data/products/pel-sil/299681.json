    "description": "PEL-SIL™ CL290 is a organo-modified silicone-based additive consisting of a siloxane backbone and polyethylene-oxide (EO) and polypropylene oxide (PO) side chains. PEL-SIL™ CE 390 has recoatability and low tendency to foam. It is good compatibility with many resin systems. PEL-SIL™ CL290 is an excellent silicone-based additive for improving slip and mar resistance and reducing friction coefficient for solvent-borne, water-borne, and UV/EB cured coating systems. It can be used for coatings in industrial and auto, wood, and overprint vanishes and inks.",
