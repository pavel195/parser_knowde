    "description": "PENESEAL PRO® is a spray applied liquid sealer which forms a sub-surface barrier that protects concrete against water penetration and seals hairline cracks. When sprayed onto a thoroughly cleansed concrete surface, it will react with the concrete to form a sub-surface gel. This gel seals the pores, capillaries and cracks. As long as water is present, the product will remain active and seal future hairline cracks.",
