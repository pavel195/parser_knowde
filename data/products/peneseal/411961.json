    "description": "PENESEAL™ FH is a clear, reactive penetrating sealer for concrete and masonry building materials designed to permanently protect, preserve and strengthen them. PENESEAL™ FH penetrates deep into concrete and reacts with the elemental concrete ingredients to solidify them into a harder, denser, stronger concrete mass. Alkali salts and minerals are flushed out in the process, eliminating efflorescence and leaching and increasing bonding of surface coatings.",
