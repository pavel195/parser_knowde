    "description": "A translucent beige compound with semi-crystalline perfluoropolymer nano-filler, specially developed to meet the demands of the semiconductor and bio-analytical industries. Compatible with fluorine based chemistries and universally suitable for both wet and dry semiconductor processes including Lithography, Plasma, PVD, CVD, Etch, Stripping and Cleaning.Perlast® G67P combines a fully fluorinated polymer backbone, a fully fluorinated nano-filler system (no inorganic fillers) and a highly fluorinated cross-linking process, which results in a perfluoroelastomer with unrivaled purity and chemical resistance.Perlast® G67P has a significantly lower compressive modulus than traditional perfluoroelastomers, making it highly compliant. So for a given compression, it exhibits a low reaction force, this results in lower stress on the seal, which leads to longer life expectancy.Key Attributes Exceptionally pure - does not contain any inorganic fillers which may cause particulation problems. Excellent chemical and temperature resistance. Excellent mechanical properties. Extremely low out-gassing properties making it ideal for vacuum sealing applications. High sealing efficiency. High material compliance reduces surface permeation. Reduced first wafer effect. Lower cost of ownership. Typical Applications Dynamic seals Static seals Wafer-handling products",
