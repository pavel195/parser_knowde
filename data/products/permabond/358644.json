    "description": "PERMABOND® ES569 is a single-part heat cured epoxy adhesive with excellent adhesion to metal surfaces as well as composite materials. The high bond strength of this adhesive allows it to replace mechanical fastening, soldering, brazing or welding. ES569 has been designed to be non-sagging, allowing the product to be used in large gaps and on vertical surfaces. It is also ideal for bonding electronic components as it has high wet strength and is non-stringing and produces an excellent drop profile as well as withstanding solder reflow processes.",
