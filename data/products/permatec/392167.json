    "description": "PERMATEC 4000 HT is a 100% solids epoxy floor topping designed for high temperature applications commonly found in many manufacturing processes. PERMATEC 4000 HT is designed to withstand constant temperatures to 212°F (100°C) and intermittent exposures to 250°F (122°C). The PERMATEC 4000 HT system consists of a two component resin binder and graded aggregate. It is applied with a trowel or screed rake at 1/8 -1/4 inches (125-250 mils) in a one coat application including a silica broadcast. There is no need for a primer or sealer coat. An optional glaze coat may be used to improve the appearance and cleanability. Where chemical exposures over 150°F are anticipated, contact ChemProof Polymers for specific recommendations. The vertical formulation of PERMATEC 4000 is trowel applied at 1/8 inches (125 mils).",
