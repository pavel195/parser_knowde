    "description": "Different types of decorative plastic beads, rhinestones, granulates and flakes with an enormous range of visual effects provide a luminous touch to designs. Tiny transparent beads and rhinestones work as lenses to intensify the beauty of a background and to leave memorable tactile sensations. At the same time, colored and large particles create a brilliant shimmer (like “Swarovski”) and are fashioned for rich designs. Different sized colored granules and flakes replicate natural materials, while adding tactile sensations and a three-dimensional effect.",
