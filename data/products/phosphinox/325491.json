    "description": "NovinoxÂ®PZ02 is an organically modified basic Zinc phosphate developed to be more reactive than standard Zinc phosphate in PU and alkyd systems. It is a stable and non-hygroscopic white powder with a low tinting strength, it is easily dispersed. The organic activator provides a higher solubility of the pigment in the initial stages of corrosion leading to a higher reactivity and protection.",
