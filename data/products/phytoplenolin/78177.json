It contains key chemical constituents known as phytoestrogens. The aroma/taste of Pueraria mirifica is described as mild. This product is associated with functional categories in food, beverage, and dietary supplements, particularly related to women's health. In cosmetic and personal care, it is associated with skin and addressing wrinkles. Pueraria mirifica has been used by the Thais for a millennium as a rejuvenator and revitalizer to help offset some of the effects of aging. It owes its functions to being a strong plant-based source of phytoestrogens, and Puresterol® is a patented and highly active compound of Pueraria mirifica available on the market.",
