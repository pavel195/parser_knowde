    "description": "TALON Super Supreme Dark Cutting and Threading Oil is a semi- transparent, high standard, anti-mist, economical, dark oil which gives clean, fast, easy cuts. In addition to its high percentage of active pure sulfur, TALON Super Supreme Dark Cutting and Threading Oil also contains a chlorine compound that keeps chaser dies sharp longer and enables them to produce clean sharp threads without tearing. TALON Super Supreme Dark Cutting and Threading Oil penetrates well into the interior cutting edges of the pipe dies and since it does not creep away from the points where heat is generated, reduces unnecessary waste.",
