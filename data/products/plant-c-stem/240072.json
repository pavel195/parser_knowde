This advanced active doesn’t just form a physical barrier, it enhances the skin’s physiological defenses, making it more resilient and stronger over time. Activoil™ Echnidium ZRO is the ideal choice for products targeting sensitive skin, functional makeup, and sanitizing solutions (as it helps prevent ethanol-induced dehydration while boosting hydration over time).</p><p> Its stabilized and ready-to-use format ensures consistent and clinically proven efficacy, making it an essential ingredient for innovative formulations that aim to provide protection and repair in a single solution.</p>",
