    "description": "<p>Innollient™ SL is a rich, buttery dermo-emollient, ideal for nourishing formulations that provide superior smoothness to the skin. More nourishing than jojoba oil, this product enhances hydration, visibly improving skin elasticity and resilience, adding an innovative and luxurious touch to creams and skincare products. Primarily composed of vegetable fatty acids, Innollient™ SL creates hydrophilic pockets that interact with water molecules through hydrogen bonding. Thanks to its distinctive structure, it boasts excellent film-forming properties, making it ideal for formulations that aim for long-lasting results and extended comfort.</p><p>The main benefits of Innollient™ SL include outstanding film-forming action and unique emollient capacity, combined with a significant improvement in the skin barrier function. It boosts hydration and skin resilience, reducing TEWL, with high spreadability and a pleasantly soft sensation. Perfect for modern formulations, it offers a rich sensorial experience and long-lasting effects.</p>",
