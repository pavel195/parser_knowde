    "description": "Imper-Sol™ AC Premium is a CRRC-rated, white acrylic roof coating that can reduce roof temperatures by 50° - 80°. The fire retardant roof coating is formulated from water-based, pure acrylic, self-curing latex polymers. It is an elastomeric coating, also contains unique bleed blocking polymers that eliminates the need for a coating primer. It is designed for application by brush, roller or spray. Once cured, Imper-Sol AC Premium preserves roof surfaces and reduces under roof temperatures to create a more pleasant interior work environment that is less costly to maintain.",
