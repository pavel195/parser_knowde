    "description": "<p>Liceryl™-12, a powerful ester derived from linoleic fatty acids, designed to elevate your cosmetic formulations. Acting as a co-surfactant with emollient and solubilizing properties, Liceryl™-12 helps reduce skin erythema and minimizes disruption to the skin barrier, often caused by surfactant penetration. Synthesized with glycerin, an endogenous component of the skin known for its humectant properties, and rich in omega-6 fatty acids from soybean oil, this ingredient enhances transparency in solutions. In cleansing products, Liceryl™-12 increases micelle size, reducing the risk of irritation and dehydration, ensuring gentle yet effective cleansing. Perfect for modern, skin-friendly formulations.</p>",
