    "description": "PolyBrite® 35 CA is a tough, superior quality water-based elastomeric coating. This proprietary formulation uses a high-tensile strength 100% acrylic resin that cures to form a seamless fluid applied armor over approved roofing substrates. PolyBrite® 35 CA can be applied as either a base or top surface coating. This product has excellent adhesion to sprayed polyurethane foam (SPUF) and a variety of other construction and roofing substrates and exceeds the tensile strength of typical acrylic roof coatings.",
