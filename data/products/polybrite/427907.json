    "description": "PolyBrite® 71-HS is a high solid, premium grade water-based elastomeric coating. This proprietary formulation uses 100% acrylic resin cures to form a seamless fluid applied roof membrane. It offers the unique ability to extend the life of a roofing system, lower overall life cycle costs, and provides excellent bleed-through resistance. When applied in white, it is highly reflective keeping the roof surface cool and providing protection from UV and other weather exposures.",
