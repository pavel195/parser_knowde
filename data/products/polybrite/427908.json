    "description": "PolyBrite® 75 is a high tensile, superior grade water-based elastomeric coating. This proprietary formulation uses 100% acrylic resins cures to form a seamless fluid applied roof membrane. It can be used as either a base or surface coat. This product has excellent adhesion to sprayed polyurethane foam (SPUF) and a variety of other construction and roofing substrates and can exceed the expected tensile strength of typical acrylic roof coatings. This product provides excellent durability and dirt pickup resistance.",
