    "description": "AFCONA 4203 is an innovative polyester dispersant concept designed by AFCONA. It is based on the latest steric hindrance structure and newly designed anchoring groups, providing excellent wetting and dispersing performance for inorganic, organic, and carbon black. AFCONA 4203 also reduces the viscosity of high pigment content pastes, and has better stability for concentrate storage over long periods. This solvent-free design is ideal for low VOC formulation designs. It is a high molecular weight polymeric dispersant for all types of pigments and is a modified polyester polymer.",
