    "description": "Sweetex Golden Flex icing is a zero grams trans-fat premium soybean based shortening that provides higher yield and more volume than traditional zero trans shortenings. It is a true drop-in for all icing applications.  Golden Flex expands the reach of non-PHO shortenings into the more challenging icing applications. Unlike most non-PHO shortenings which suffer reduced functionality and flexibility compared to PHO shortening, Golden Flex is a true PHO-free drop-in replacement.",
