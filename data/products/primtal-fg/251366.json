    "description": "AMINOTAL SUPER is a Bioactivator made out of free amino acids obtained by acid hydrolysis. The elements contained in this product work both activating the biological processes of the plant and as a fast supply source of Nitrogen. It contains a balanced aminogram that allows its use at any time during the crop development. AMINOTAL SUPER improves the assimilation of other mineral nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, trace elements, etc.), and also intensifies the action of fungicides, insecticides and contact weedkillers, so its application along with them is recommended. AMINOTAL is specially recommended in cold periods, as it promotes and speeds up the crop development, reinforcing the plants vigor and improving their resistance to cold and certain diseases. It is also recommended in order to promote the crop development during its first stages (young plants or recently transplanted), during critical stages of growth and to face stress situations.",
