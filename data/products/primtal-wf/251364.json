    "description": "ALGATON ECO is a Biostimulant made out of marine algae natural extracts and enriched with Boron and Molybde num This product has a high stimulating power, because it contains algae extract that provides a high ratio of natural phytohormones (cytokinins, auxins, gibberellins....) amino acids and carbohydrates (alginic acid, mannitol, la-minarine, ...) which, once applied, permeates the cellular tissues and has an influence in the plant's physiological processes, stimulating its growth and blooming.ALGATON is recommended as a stimulant of the metabolic activity of the plant since the elements it contains favors the process related to flowering, fruit set and fruit ripening, as well as to overcome adverse situations or stress. It also favors the homogeneity of the fruits and their resistance to transport. ALGATON application is recommended from sprouting, in pre-flowering, flowering and in the stages of further development of the crop.",
