    "description": "Foliartal 17-7-6 +T.E. is a foliar liquid NPK fertilizer, fastly absorbed and assimilated by the crop, rich in Nitrogen and trace elements, specially designed for foliar application as a source of the elements present on its formula. Its application notably enhances the vegetation of the treated crop during the first stages, promoting sprouting and supplying the necessary elements in the crop’s active development periods. FOLIARTAL 17-7-6 + T.E. is recommended as a complement for basal dressing, specially when the crop’s Nitrogen nutritional needs are higher, such as sprouting, preblooming and fruit formation.",
