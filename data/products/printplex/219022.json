    "description": "CERETAN® MPS 3120 is a micronized polypropylene wax, coated with Silica.excellent matting effect high transparency excellent slip excellent scratch resistance good heat resistance. Application in paints and coatings, such as industrial paints, wood coatings, overprint varnishes and UV-coating systems.CERETAN ® micronized waxes are predominantly produced using our highly advanced spraying technology leading to spherical particles. The spherical shape and the particles’ even surface help the dispersing process, reduce wax usage as well as dust formation. We guarantee D99 values to minimize oversized particles in your formulation. ",
