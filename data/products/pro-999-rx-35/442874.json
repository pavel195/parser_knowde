    "description": "Pro-999 Rx-35® Sealer/Primer is a sealer/primer that penetrates and seals porous surfaces such as torn drywall, drywall mud and spackle to enable the wall surface to be painted or wallpapered. PRO-999 seals old wallpaper paste residue (excess paste must be removed first by sanding with 80 grit sandpaper, then dust removed). PRO-999 dries clear with a slight residual tack, enhancing adhesion of paint or wallcovering.",
