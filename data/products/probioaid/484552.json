    "description": "ActiCPP™ is a form of Casein Phosphopeptides (CPP) derived from milk casein, and it is produced using a unique cocktail of enzymes and a multi-step enzymatic hydrolysis process to achieve a high concentration of CPP (&gt;40%). In contrast, many other CPP manufacturers can only produce CPP with a maximum concentration of 20%. Additionally, the identity and concentration of ActiCPP™ have been independently verified by a third-party laboratory.CPP has been scientifically demonstrated to enhance the absorption of calcium and other divalent ions, with the ultimate goal of serving as a preventive measure against the development of osteoporosis",
