    "description": "ProbioAid® KDPH is a heat-sealed Lactobacillus sakei, a potent postbiotic that enhances the immune system. ProbioAid® KDPH triggers the production of Nitric Oxide (NO). Studies indicate that this NO-producing bacterium increases IgA concentration and secretion rates while significantly activating immune factors. Furthermore, it effectively acts as an antibacterial activity against Candida albicans to prevent mucosal infections in areas such as the mouth, esophagus, and vagina.",
