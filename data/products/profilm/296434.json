    "description": "Santicizer速 141 is a fast-fusing, non-halogen, fire retardant plasticizer used in multiple polymer systems. This plasticizer is recommended for applications where there is a need to reduce the risk of fire. This versatile additive has FDA clearances making it an option for applications that involve indirect food contact. In PVC, Santicizer速 141 acts as a high solvating plasticizer, offering performance, faster fusion and high plasticizing efficiency. Santicizer速 141 is also used as a lubricant additive, hydraulic fluid, and rubber processing aid.",
