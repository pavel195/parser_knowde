    "description": "Santicizer速 148 is a fast-fusing, non-halogen, fire retardant plasticizer used in multiple polymer systems. This plasticizer is recommended for applications where there is a need to reduce the risk of fire. Santicizer速 148 helps to suppress smoke during combustion of materials it is used in. In PVC, Santicizer速 148 acts as a high solvating plasticizer, offering permanence, faster fusion and high plasticizing efficiency.",
