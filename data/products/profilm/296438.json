    "description": "Santicizer速 278 is a fast fusing, benzyl phthalate plasticizer designed for use in multiple polymer systems and applications. This plasticizer is a high molecular weight alkyl benzyl phthalate that has compatibility in many polymer types, particularly in PVC. Santicizer速 278 is extremely permanent. It resists exudation and extraction and has very low volatility. Additionally, Santicizer速 278 has shown sound dampening benefits, and has benefits in wet applications of paint.",
