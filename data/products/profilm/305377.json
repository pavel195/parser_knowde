    "description": "Santicizer® 1438 is a modified alkyl aryl phosphate\nester for flexible PVC products that must meet\nstringent flame retardancy standards. Santicizer®\n1438 is specially recommended for plastisol\napplications where lower viscosity is combined with\nhigh fire-retardancy of the end product. Santicizer®\n1438 exhibits superior flow properties and plasticizer\nefficiency compared to triaryl phosphate esters at\nequal concentrations. Santicizer® 1438 can be used\nat lower concentrations for similar flame spread\nwithout affecting tensile properties.",
