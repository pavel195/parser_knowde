    "description": "Proflex® MS-225 is a moisture sealer is a unique one-part, multi-functional moisture barrier that dries to a clear film that is alkali and water-resistant. It is designed for use on interior porous concrete substrates as a penetrating and film-forming hydrophobic (water repelling) barrier to protect flooring installations against moisture vapor transmission rates of up to 15 lbs. Per 1000 sq. ft. per 24 hours and in-situ Relative Humidity (RH) moisture readings up to 95%. The multi-functionality of the product results from the barrier coating ability to prime porous concrete and eliminate dust, and to neutralize surface alkalinity by forming a barrier coating that provides an acceptable pH level and block migration of alkaline salts through the slab.)",
