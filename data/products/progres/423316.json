    "description": "Progut速 Extra is a new generation yeast. It is a refined version of Progut速 produced by stronger hydrolysis which results in a higher content of soluble bioactive structures and thus enhanced biological responses. This gives a possibility to reduce the inclusion rates and makes the product especially suitable for challenging conditions and for ruminant applications. Progut速 Extra delivers the benefits of a yeast hydrolysate in a concentrated form. It improves animal performance in different conditions by efficiently activating immune protection and modulating gut microbiota. A powerful enhancer of rumen microbial fermentation resulting in improved production performance of ruminants.",
