    "description": "Vegequat® is a vegetable derived surfactant containing coconut fatty acids and hydrolyzed wheat proteins. Thanks to the combination of the cationic function and the protein group, it has remarkable conditioning and antistatic properties. Vegequat effectively protects hair from physical aggression and chemical dryness such as hairdryer, hair permanents and dyes, while in foaming products has a thickening and stabilizing effect on foam. In skincare, it protects the hydrolipidic film during\r\nwashing and hydrates skin, thanks to its protein portion.",
