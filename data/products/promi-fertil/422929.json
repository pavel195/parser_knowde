    "description": "Promi-Fertil® 18-8-6 is a NPK liquid foliar fertilizer with rapid absorption and assimilation rich in nitrogen. Its application contributes to a significant increase in the vegetative development of the crop, especially during the first phenological stages. It favors sprouting and provides the necessary macronutrients in periods of active growth of the crop. It can also be used when the nutritional needs of the crop are higher in nitrogen, such as sprouting, pre-flowering and setting. It is a liquid formulation suitable for the development phases of all crops and to enhance photosynthesis thanks to its high nitrogen content.",
