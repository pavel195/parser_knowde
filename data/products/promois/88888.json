    "description": "Promois™ SILK-1000F is hydrolyzed silk protein with hair conditioning efficacy. Silk protein is formed of two proteins: fibroin and sericin. Fibroin has a unique amino acid composition. It is rich in glycine, alanine and serine which have small molecular weight and simple chemical structure. This composition is known to form a sheet structure to which is associated the comfortable touch of silk. Many of the amino acids of sericin have hydroxyl groups which provides uncomparable moisturizing effect. Promois™ series is a range of peptides and derivatives obtained through hydrolysis of natural proteins. There are also products with different preservatives. It is developed and manufactured in Japan by SEIWA KASEI.",
