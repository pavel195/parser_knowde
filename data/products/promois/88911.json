    "description": "Promois™ WK-HSIGF is a silylated derivative type of hydrolyzed keratin. It protects and repairs hair, and improves its texture by a heat enhancing effect that results in the formation of a film on the hair in response to heat from hair dryers or hair ironing. Keratin is one of the structural proteins composing the stratum corneum, hair, and nails. It makes up 80% of human hair. About its amino acid composition, it must be noted that keratin has plenty of cystine, the amino acid that forms a bond between the helix of the protein and thus provides physical resistance to the hair structure as well as moisture. This is why it is important to supply keratin regularly through hair care products. Promois™ series is a range of peptides and derivatives obtained through hydrolysis of natural proteins. There are also products with different preservatives. It is developed and manufactured in Japan by SEIWA KASEI.",
