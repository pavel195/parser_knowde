    "description": "Vegetamide™ 18MEA-R, \"Plant-derived Liquid Cuticle\" has aliphatic cationic compounds of rice peptides with hair conditioning efficacy. The F-Layer, which main component is called 18-MEA, is the barrier structure of hair cuticles, but it can be stripped off due to hair damage. Because Vegetamide™'s structure mimics the structure of the F-Layer, it can repair and restore the hair cuticles to a healthy state and improve its texture. This product is preservative free. It is developed and manufactured in Japan by SEIWA KASEI.",
