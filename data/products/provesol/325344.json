    "description": "PROFIBER N is a natural functional ingredient with a high content of dietary fiber, obtained from the segregation of the insoluble fraction of defatted soy flour and submitted to a suitable heat treatment for the inactivation of antinutritional and microbiological factors. It comes in the form of a fine powder and is a highly biodigestible nutritional fiber concentrate. The daily intake of dietary fiber provides a number of benefits to human health. These benefits are related to the increase in bolus and fecal moisture, as long as the intake is accompanied by fluids (it is recommended to ingest at least 2 liters of water a day). This maintains the structural integrity of the mucous membranes, decreasing the incidence of various diseases such as colon cancer and intestinal infections.",
