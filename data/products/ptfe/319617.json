    "description": "Polyimide /PI Glide™ Tubing is a class of high performing polymers well established in industry for their outstanding chemical, thermal, and mechanical performance properties. Polyimides typically do not melt before decomposing; thus, they demonstrate excellent thermal stability in high as well as low temperatures. Polyimides also exhibit good dielectric properties giving them substantial presence in a number of electrical applications. Zeus polyimide tubing brings these properties and more for both medical and non-medical precision tubing applications. Polyimide tubing provides excellent strength and abrasion resistance. Polyimide tubing also maintains its properties even at very small dimensions. For applications where additional lubricity is needed, PI Glide™, a PI / PTFE composite, provides a lower coefficient of friction for reduced surface resistance of the tubing. Zeus polyimide tubing is also available in a layered or composite construction using a combination of PI and PI Glide™ to suit a variety of tubing requirements. Mechanical properties, lubricious surface, and many other tubing properties can be tailored in this way. Choosing Zeus PI and PI Glide™ tubing for your catheter construction needs allows users to consolidate their components with a single best-in-class supplier.",
