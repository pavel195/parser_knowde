    "description": "Pure Performance®110N is a high purity, low viscosity paraffinic oil produced from a high-pressure hydrocracking and hydro-dewaxing process that removes virtually all metals, sulfur, and nitrogen from the feedstock. Pure Performance® 110N features lower NOACK volatility than other Group II 4 cSt base oils, which is an advantage for engine oil formulations.",
