    "description": "Challenge 543-HT is a medium viscosity lapping / polishing slurry additive which evenly disperses and suspends a variety of non-suspension-treated abrasives, including aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, along with silicon carbide, boron carbide, synthetic and natural diamond, and garnet. Because of its superior suspension characteristics, Challenge 543-HT reduces the amount of abrasive grain needed by up to 50%, while providing equal, and often greater, stock removal rates. It is particularly effective when using equipment with smaller slurry feed tubes, which constrict flow of high viscosity products. It is a single-pass lapping additive for use on ceramics in the Optic industry.",
