    "description": "Vector HTN was developed for use in \"high-speed recirculating\" and \"high-speed once-through\" slurry pumping systems. Utilizing the energy of a high-speed pump, standard on most lapping machines, it evenly disperses aluminum oxide, cerium oxide, silicon carbide, boron carbide, and garnet abrasive. It also reduces abrasive usage by eliminating \"hard-packing\" and waste. Vector HTN should not be used in \"low shear\" mixing/pumping systems. It is a lapping and polishing additive (recirculating).",
