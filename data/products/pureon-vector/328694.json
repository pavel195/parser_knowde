    "description": "Challenge 300-HT is a synthetic formulation developed to optimize removal rate and surface finish in grinding, sawing, and dicing processes using diamond grinding wheels and blades. The productâ€™s exceptional heat transfer characteristics insure prolonged diamond life, even with the most difficult materials. Challenge 300-HT is compatible with all filtration systems, and its foam-free operation promotes operator acceptance. It is a synthetic grinding fluid which improves rates, finish, grind consistency, and wheel life. New customers should instead consider the Challenge 300-HT, which offers superior performance.",
