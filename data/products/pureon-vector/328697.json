    "description": "Vector HTI is a synthetic formulation developed for use in \"once-through\" processes using I.D. diamond blades. With its exceptional heat transfer capability, Vector HTI quickly cools the diamond blade for longer diamond life, while the productâ€™s superior detergency keeps the diamond interface clean and free cutting for both increased cutting speed and reduced blade deflection. A next generation version of this product has been developed which offers improved performance. It is a Synthetic I.D. sawing and grinding fluid (single-pass).",
