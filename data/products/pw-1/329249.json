    "description": "FSS 50DM+™ is a 100% solids, fast setting, plu-ral component, polyurea elastomer and high perfor-mance coating. FSS 50DM+ is primarily designed for properly prepared steel and metal substrates, however, due to it’s higher modulus, and faster gel times, FSS 50DM+ has excellent bond to concrete, masonry and other properly prepared substrates. FSS 50DM+ can be applied horizontally, vertically, and overhead, making it ideal for industrial applications with a variety of sub-strates, and complex geometries.",
