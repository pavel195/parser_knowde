    "description": "VF 380-F™ is a 100% solids elastomeric polyurea developed for applications such as geotextile lining membranes. VF380-F may also be applied to concrete and steel substrates. VF380-F is a volatile free, odorless system applied with 1:1 mix ratio with plural component spray equipment. VersaFlex VF380-F provides less shrinkage with improved elongation characteristics. As a result, VF380-F makes an excellent polyurea for liners, geotextile coatings, and applications where resilience and durability are required. VF380-F may be applied at varying thicknesses in a single application using a multi-pass spray technique.",
