    "description": "VF 20™ is a versatile two-component urethane based primer designed for a variety of substrates. It’s unique formulation allows for dilution with acetone by 33-50% for improved penetration, coverage, and adhesion. VF-20 may be applied at temperatures greater than 0˚ F by airless sprayer, roller, squeegee, or broom. VF-20 may be used with all VersaFlex rapid curing sealants and coatings for interior and exterior application. VF-20 has been designed along with VF-15 to offer versatility and flexibility in primer selection. VF-20 is ideal for use when longer working time is needed. While VF-20 will cure down to 0˚ F it is ideal at temperatures above 75˚ F. VF-15 is typically preferred at temperatures between 40—75˚ F or at elevated temperatures when a faster re-coat is required such as smaller projects or where quick return to service is needed.",
