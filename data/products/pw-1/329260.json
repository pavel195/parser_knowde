    "description": "Versaproof™ Primer E is a 100% solids, zero VOC, two component, epoxy sealer and primer. VersaProof Primer E is a penetrating primer/sealer, uniquely formulated to reduce outgassing and improve adhesion. VersaProof Primer E is ideal for damp concrete substrates, or substrates where trapped moisture and/or high moisture vapor drive is expected, such as split slab construction, or with stay in place forms. VersaProof Primer E is typically thinned by 50% with Acetone, and may be applied at temperatures greater than 40° F by airless or air assisted spraying, brush, roller, or squeegee. VersaProof Primer E may be used with all VersaProof rapid curing sealants and coatings for interior and exterior application.",
