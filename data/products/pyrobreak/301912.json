    "description": "PyroCide™ Clear is a two component thin film intumescent coating formulated for existing and new wood structures where the appearance of the wood is important. PyroCide™ Clear will not bubble, haze or crack. It has enough water resistance for interior applications to allow the coating to have an occasional wipe with a damp cloth and maintain its finish.An intumescent coating is a proprietary formulated blend of compounds which, at ambient temperatures, remain perfectly stable and nonreactive. When the temperature increases, its components undergo a chemical reaction and produce an extended char. This carbonaceous char has a volume many times that of the original thin coating and its low thermal conductivity provides insulation and protects the substrate from the effects of fire propagation.",
