    "description": "PyroBreak EX-2 is a water based flame retardant system containing a wetting agent designed to increase the rate and depth at which the fire retardant will penetrate paper, paperboard, wood, and fabric substrates. The flame retardant saturant works by reducing the threshold ignition temperature and completely dehydrating the cellulose fibers. This alters the decomposition favoring the formation of non-flammable char and significantly reducing the formation of combustible tars.",
