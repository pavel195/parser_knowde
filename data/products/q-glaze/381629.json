    "description": "Edgetherm® 3500 single-part butyl sealant is a single-part butyl-based sealant that sets quickly from its molten state, allowing units to be moved from their assembly locations between two and five minutes after application and glazed the same day. A combination of high output and fast heat-loss properties reduce the risk of corner defects for a complete seal around the unit.",
