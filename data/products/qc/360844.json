    "description": "Cera-Lube™ Nano Ceramic Grease is a high-performance, highly stable lubricant that delivers unmatched performance, durability, and wear resistance. It outlasts PTFE greases in the same applications by ten times due to its lower friction coefficient and its ability to operate in a wider range of temperatures. Cera-Lube has high load-bearing properties; a low dielectric constant; does not contain metal or silicone; and is resistant to water, steam, acids, and most chemical products, giving the lubricant greater longevity, even under intense pressures and temperatures.",
