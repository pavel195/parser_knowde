    "description": "Syn-Lube™ High Performance Synthetic Grease is an extraordinary, state-of-the art synthetic lubricating grease that’s NSF Listed. Food-and medical-grade, the calcium sulfonate formula does not contain metals, PTFE, or silicone. With antioxidants, extreme pressure additives, and anti-wear additives, SYN-LUBE outlasts and outperforms virtually all other greases on the market. PTFE lubricants and other food-grade greases (calcium-based, clay-based, aluminum complex-based) just can’t match the exceptional friction reduction and wear resistance of SYN-LUBE. Designed for the most severe industrial and food applications, SYN-LUBE is the right choice if you’re looking for a universal grease for all of your needs.",
