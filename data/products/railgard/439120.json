    "description": "EpoxyGrip® 2300 is used as a universal primer over marginally prepared steel substrates and as a bonding (tie) coat over old existing, aged coatings. The outstanding wetting characteristics of EpoxyGrip 2300 allows the coating to penetrate tightly adherent rust and voids in existing coatings to yield a sound base for a wide variety of fresh topcoats. Being solvent free, edges of existing coatings are not lifted thus reducing undercutting and peeling of the existing coating. Excellent for use as a tie coat over existing coatings, as well as over rusted and pitted steel surfaces. Excellent for use on structural steel, steel tanks, barges, water tanks, refineries petrochemical plants, power plants, railcars, pulp &amp; paper mills and others as recommended. Acceptable as a primer for drywall substrates.",
