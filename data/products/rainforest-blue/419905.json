    "description": "Black Currant Cellular Extract are created using purified, deionized rain-harvested water and less plant material to produce a True to Nature extract. With attention to eco-sustainable practices, traceable to source and transparent in composition ingredients – Cellular Extracts deliver the brilliance of nature. The humble blackcurrant really isn’t humble at all, it is a gem in the British countryside. Black Currants have been growing in the British countryside since the 17th century, records suggest, when blackcurrants were revered for their many medicinal qualities. The deep purple pigment of the black currant is attributed to its high anthocyanin content. Anthocyanin's are plant pigments that produce a red, purple or blue hue. The NE Black Currant Cellular Extract’s additional phyto-compounds may be considered for more benefits below, delivering natural molecules in a water- soluble format, including anthocyanin, myricetin, rutin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, quercetin, phenolics, amino acids and more.",
