With attention to eco-sustainable practices, traceable to source and transparent in composition ingredients – Cellular Extracts deliver the brilliance of nature. Cucumber is 96 percent water, making it a hydrating addition to skin treatments as well as being generally safe for sensitive skin due to its lack of harsh, potentially irritating ingredients. The NE Cucumber Cellular Extract’s phyto-compounds may be considered for broad premature aging products, in addition to attenuating certain skin disorders and improving skin and hair condition. The NE Cucumber Cellular Extract delivers natural molecules in a water-soluble format, including sugars, organic and amino acids, tryptophan, and flavonoid glycosides.",
