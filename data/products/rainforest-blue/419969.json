    "description": "Yerba Mate Cellular Extract is extracted rapidly under high pressure, we capture the natural molecules. Committed to conscious manufacturing, Cellular Extracts are created using purified, deionised rain-harvested water and less plant material to produce a True to Nature extract. With attention to eco-sustainable practices, traceable to source and transparent in composition ingredients Cellular Extracts deliver the brilliance of nature. Yerba mate is known by some as “the green tea of South America.” The leaves of the tree are made into a tea and traditionally consumed from a small gourd through a metal straw. It is renowned for its nourishing properties in central and southern regions of South America and Argentina, and this practice of drinking it has remained relatively unchanged for over 500 years. Sharing from this traditional gourd is said to be a sign of friendship, bonding and to taste yerba mate is to taste history. An antioxidant powerhouse, the NE Yerba Mate Cellular Extract’s phyto-compounds, including caffeine, can particularly be considered for firming and toning skin as well as numerous skin conditions, including blemishes, reactive skin, fine lines and wrinkles, inflammation, hair maintenance and protection and more.",
