    "description": "DeTERGE LF - 7315 is a low-foaming, modified amphoteric surfactant ideal for highly alkaline and acidic systems. It functions effectively as the primary surfactant, offering wetting and detergency in both acidic and alkaline environments. Its excellent solubility may eliminate the need for a hydrotrope. Moreover, it is biodegradable, non-phenolic, and phosphate-free.",
