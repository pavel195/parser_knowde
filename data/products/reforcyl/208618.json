    "description": "DEFENSIL速-PLUS is a highly effective first-aid kit to alleviate stressed, sensitive and irritable skin. The outstanding properties of blackcurrant seed oil and balloon vine extract in combination with sunflower oil concentrate effectively reduce inflammatory processes and replenish the damaged skin barrier.\nDEFENSIL速-PLUS soothes various forms of skin irritation; acute irritation as a result of razor burn, or from mosquito bites are both significantly reduced. Chemically irritated skin also is protected and gently regenerated. In summary, DEFENSIL速-PLUS markedly relieves dry, itchy, allergy-prone\nskin and gives those plagued by eczema a new lease of life.
