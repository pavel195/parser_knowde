    "description": "MYRAMAZE®, an extract of Myrothamnus flabellifolia, is like an oasis for stressed, “desert-like” skin with a particularly high proportion of protective substances. It protects membrane structures from dehydration and preserves the most important skin lipid linoleic acid, against oxidation. A one-time application of MYRAMAZE® invigorates the skin for more than 48 hours. With regular use, MYRAMAZE® effectively revives, regenerates and strengthens skin that is stressed, attacked and depleted.",
