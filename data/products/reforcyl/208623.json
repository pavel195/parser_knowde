    "description": "RADICARE®-GOLD reproduces the protective concept employed by Tetradesmus obliquus and can be applied to the skin to provide it with a “Faraday shield” to screen it from radiation.\nNatural carotenoids have a dual effect on skin cells and barrier: as they activate PPARγ, they both defend skin cells against the effects of ROS and inhibit lipid peroxidation. Furthermore,\nthe product replenishes the carotenoid depot of the skin barrier and provides a more juvenile appearance of the skin.\nSo, put on your personal Faraday shield to help your skin resist intrinsic ROS stress and the stress caused by radiation from the natural and more recent digital sources – such as blue light\nand even WiFi.
