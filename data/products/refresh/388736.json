    "description": "reFRESH™ 386 is a tan, free-flowing powder produced via the traditional fermentation of onion juice with Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) bacteria. This process produces a complex mixture of organic acids, peptides, and other fermented compounds that contribute a mild and savory flavor. Like other fermented foods (e.g. vinegar, buttermilk, etc.), this product may provide a desirable flavor profile in many food applications and assists in maintaining the quality of perishable foods during their expected shelf-life. reFRESH™ 386 works especially well in foods where appropriate hydration and distribution of the ingredient are easily accommodated.",
