    "description": "bioVONTAGE® 2447 is a tan, free-flowing powder produced via the traditional fermentation of sugar with Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) bacteria. This process produces a complex mixture of organic acids, peptides and other fermented compounds that contribute a mild and savory flavor. Like other fermented foods, e.g. vinegar, buttermilk etc, this product may provide a desirable flavor profile in many applications and maintain the quality of the foods during shelf-life. bioVONTAGE 2447 works especially well in foods where the formulation includes a minimal amount of water or other non-oil based liquids.",
