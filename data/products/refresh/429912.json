    "description": "bioVONTAGE® 6328 is a tan, free-flowing powder produced via the traditional fermentation of sugar with Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) bacteria. This process produces a complex mixture of organic acids, peptides and other fermented compounds that contribute a savory, fermented flavor. Like other fermented foods (vinegar, buttermilk etc.), this product may provide a desirable flavor profile and help maintain the quality of the foods during shelf-life. bioVONTAGE 6328 works well in foods that are both heated during production, as well as ones that include no thermal processing.",
