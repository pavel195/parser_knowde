    "description": "bioVONTAGE® 7374 is a tan, free-flowing powder produced via the traditional fermentation of dextrose with Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) bacteria. This process produces a complex mixture of organic acids, peptides and other fermented compounds that contribute a savory, fermented and deep flavor. Like other fermented foods, e.g. vinegar, buttermilk etc, this product may provide a desirable flavor profile and help maintain the quality of the foods during shelf-life. bioVONTAGE 7374 works well in refrigerated food applications.",
