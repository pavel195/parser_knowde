    "description": "Cipadur 4203 is a solvent-free polyisocyanate, emulsifiable in water. Recommended for crosslinking aqueous polymer dispersions, such as polyurethane dispersions, polyvinyl acetate (homopolymer and copolymer) and polyacrylate. Crosslinking increases the resistance of the glue to heat, water, plasticizers and many organic solvents.",
