    "description": "AGC Chemicals Americas, Inc. RESIFA™ SUNSPERA™ DM H-302 silica gel has a significant effect on the polymerization process and properties of the finished polymer. The pore structure, spherical shape, and particle distribution of SUNSPERA™ DM H-302 particles are precisely defined. Using them as catalyst supports improves the morphology and increases the bulk density of the finished polymer resin, as well as improves productivity. SUNSPERA™ DM H-302 is suitable for both liquid phase/slurry processes and gas phase processes.",
