    "description": "ResinLab® RC8040 anaerobic retaining compounds are designed for use in demanding applications to fill the spaces and surface irregularities between tightly mated cylindrical parts. These products form a tough permanent bond which greatly enhances the torque and pullout strength. They are single component solvent free materials manufactured in a wide variety of viscosities and setting times to satisfy specific bonding applications. This technology increases the reliability and performance of assemblies while reducing dependence upon maintaining costly tight machining tolerances.",
