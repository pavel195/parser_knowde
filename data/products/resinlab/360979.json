    "description": "Resinlab® EP1056LC Black Part A is a two-part urethane modified epoxy adhesive designed to give good adhesion to metals and hard to bond surfaces such as PVC. It is thixotropic to provide good gap filling ability and prevent running and sagging during cure. It has very good resistance to water, acids and bases and most organic solvents. EP1056LC Black was formulated to a 2A:1B by volume mix ratio for use in side by side dispensing cartridges and meter/mix and dispense equipment. It will reach handle cure at room temperature within 8 – 16 hours. Cure time can be accelerated by the application of heat. Times and temperatures from 2 hours at 65°C to 10 minutes at 100°C are typical for most applications. Time to heat substrate must be taken into account. Cooler temperatures will also extend work time and increase cure times.",
