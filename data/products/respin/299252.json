    "description": "Respin Frilac is a natural resin ideal for food coating formulations since our plant-based product has anti-mold characteristics and is capable of awarding shine and gloss to food coatings when added into its formulation. Our flaked product is extracted from a native tree to Brazil, the Parana Pine, and modified to become a natural resin for food coating formulations. Our product is presented in gold-brown laminated, thin scales so that it can be easily dissolved in solvents and provide a high degree of brilliance for food coating formulations.",
