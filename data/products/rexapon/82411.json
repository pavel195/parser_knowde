    "description": "The ALKEST® CSO 400H is composed of surfactants resulting from the reaction of castor oil with ethylene oxide (EO). By increasing the degree of ethoxylation, the hydrophilic character of the molecule is increased (higher HLB), which represents increasing water solubility, cloud points and pour points. This product can be used as emulsifier, antistatic agent, lubricant and solubilizer in various markets and product applications.",
