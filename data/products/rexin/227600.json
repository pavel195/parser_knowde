    "description": "POLURENE AD is recommended for two pack polyurethane systems where good surface hardness, durability, brightness and solvent resistance are required. The final properties of coatings depend on the type and on the quantity of the OH terminated polymer that is used as the first component. Due to its aromatic content, POLURENE AD can be used for indoor and outdoor coatings, when a good yellowing resistance is not requested.",
