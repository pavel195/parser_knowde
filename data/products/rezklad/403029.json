    "description": "Carbo Vitrobond速 Mortar is a 100% carbon filled, plasticized, hot-pour, sulfur based mortar. It is easily melted, does not settle out in the pot, has very little odor, pours smoothly and freely and is dense and strong. The principle use of Carbo Vitrobond速 Mortar is for corrosive conditions involving hydrofluoric acid or fluoride salts. It has the same chemical resistance as VITROBOND as well as fluoride resistance. Carbo Vitrobond速 Mortar can be used as a bonding agent for acid resistant brick in lining reaction vessels, storage tanks, towers, trenches, sumps, processing tanks and equipment, pickling tanks for stainless steel and waste treatment tanks. It is also used in the installation of corrosion resistant industrial floors. CARBO-VITROBOND may be used in a variety of special applications.",
