    "description": "MEADOWESTOLIDE provides measureable and meaningful consumer benefits. In hair, the estolide improves intra-fiber moisture retention and thereby imparts protection from thermal damage, while restoring the elasticity and reducing the coefficient of friction of the hair cuticle surface to prevent mechanical damage. In skincare systems, MEADOWESTOLIDE helps to adjust the hydration levels of the interstitial spaces and provides significant moisturization benefits. These benefits are often perceived as softer, more pliant tissue. Initial investigations suggest that the estolide will prove to be a very important agent in protecting skin from the damaging effects of a variety of common causes.\n\nDownload Formulation",
