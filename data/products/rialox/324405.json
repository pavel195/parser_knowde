    "description": "RIALOX B 120 GF10 Z natur is in Granules, Natural Color. RIABLEND ® product line includes all plastic compounds that consist of at least two polymers. On the one hand, we combine polymers that can be easily combined with one another due to their chemical structure. On the other hand, our blends are also polymers that would not necessarily go together straight away, which we combine using a compatibilizer. With our egg-laying wool milk sow, you have a multitude of possible combinations - and thus also various properties of the plastics - at your disposal.",
