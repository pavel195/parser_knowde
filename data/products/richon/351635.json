    "description": "Richon® Vulcanizing Agent DTDC is mainly used for curing agent of natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, which can partially or completely replace the sulfur. Applicable to the manufacture of cables, wires, heat-resistant products, thick products and medical rubber plug..It has good performance on mechanical properties, heat resistance, aging resistance, small compression permanent deformation, no blooming, long scorching time, fast curing, etc. It is best for tire, heat-resistant rubber products, health and color rubber products, and could replace of DTDM due to there is none nitrosamines release..",
