    "description": "RonJohn® Liquid Strip is a low viscosity version of a unique solvent blend that effectively and safely removes most paints, coatings, and adhesives. It is safe for use on metals, wood, fiberglass, concrete, and certain plastics like polyester, polyethylene, and nylon. It can quickly soften or dissolve the toughest of coatings including ship anti-fouling paints, aerospace catalyzed urethanes and epoxies, and many chemical resistant coatings such as Halar® and CARC. RonJohn® Liquid Strip makes short work of wood varnish and concrete epoxy. It is a safer and more environmentally friendly replacement for processes that use toxic or flammable products like methylene chloride, MEK, alcohols, and other conventional solvents; better still, RonJohn® Liquid Strip is a drop in alternative that works at room temperature. RonJohn® Liquid Strip is as effective as its conventional counter-parts at removing polyurethane, epoxy, enamel, acrylic, and powder-coating. It dissolves vinyl, polycarbonate, PVC, and plexi-glass. It can even be used to remove burned on carbon deposits.",
