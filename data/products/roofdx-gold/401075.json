    "description": "RoofDX Copper­­™ is an extremely tough, metallic, rubberlike, waterproofing coating with a very attractive copper finish that will actually patina due to its composition of copper flakes. This amazing \"liquid copper\" coating can be applied to any common roofing substrate and will give the appearance of copper sheet roofing at a fraction of the cost. ROOFDX COPPER, like copper sheet, will develop a classic green patina, or it can be sealed with CLEARCOAT 44 to keep its new appearance.",
