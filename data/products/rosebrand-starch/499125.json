    "description": "ROSECO® CSB S3 is a bio-compostable starch compound resin derived from tapioca starch and biopolymers, is characterized by its high bio-content and exceptional mechanical properties, making it well-suited for blown film applications. With warm beige pellets, it provides high toughness and mechanical performance for blown film applications. With a significant renewable material content, CSB S3 effectively reduces the carbon footprint in end products while enhancing functionality and mechanical attributes. It's also easily processed using conventional extrusion machinery.",
