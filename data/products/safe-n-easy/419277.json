This product is zero VOC, water-based, non-flammable, and biodegradable. Peel Away®1 is easily applied on interior and exterior wood, brick, stone, concrete, stucco, plaster, metal, steel, cast iron, fiberglass, carved and molded surfaces, and many more! All Peel Away® 1 containers contain a complete paint removal kit, including Dumond® Laminated Paper, Citri-Lize™ Neutralizer, a pH test kit, and a plastic applicator under the lid.
