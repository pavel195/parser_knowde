    "description": "PELECTRON PVL is a polymer-alloy type permanent antistatic agent for polyolefin resins (e. g. polyethylene, and polypropylene) which was developed by using an original Sanyo Chemical compatibilization technique. This product imparts a long-lasting antistatic property to polyolefin resins while causing practically no lowering of their physical properties and moldability. This product dry-blended with polyolefin can be directly molded without a kneading process because this product exhibits excellent dispersibility in polyolefin. In addition, compared to conventional permanent antistatic agents, PELECTRON PVL exhibits an excellent antistatic property even when used in small amounts because this product substantially decreases surface resistivity of polyolefin.",
