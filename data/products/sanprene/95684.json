    "description": "ECONOL TM-22 is a hair conditioner base containing approx. 45 wt % alkyltrimethyl-ammonium chloride as an active ingredient, and approx. 55 wt % alcohol, composed from cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol (50/50 mixture), as a solvent. ECONOL TM-22 can be used as a hair conditioner base, because it imparts excellent detangling and moisture retention abilities and softness to hair. This product is easily applicable as a base material of hair conditioners and hair treatments, because it contains no low-boiling-point solvents including isopropanol.",
