    "description": "CATION LQ imparts long-lasting smoothness and softness to hair. It performs as a conditioning agent when used in shampoos.CATION LQ is a lanolin-based cationic surfactant containing approx. 65 wt % of N(N'-lanolin fatty acid amide propyl)-N-ethyl-N,N-dimethylammonium ethylsulfate as the active ingredient, and 1,3-butylene glycol and water as solvents.  This product has the features of both lanolin and cationic surfactants (e.g., a moisturizing effect, an antistatic property and a tactile property), making it optimal for use as a base in hair conditioners and treatments. It is also suitable for use as the conditioner ingredient in shampoos with built-in conditioners due to its compatibility with anionic surfactants. ",
