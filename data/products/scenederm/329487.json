    "description": "Porphyderm® Porphyridium Extract is red micro-algae of marine origin belonging to the rhodophyta class. It does not have flagella and has a spherical or ovoid shape the size of 1-40 µm.Its cells, of varying colors of red depending on age and culture conditions, are coated in a mucilaginous sheath of polysaccharides. Unlike plants, red microalgae have no real cell wall; their mucilage cover protects them from harsh environmental conditions such as heat or strong light. This is also how they are protected from attack due to salts.In addition to ordinary pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids, Rhodophytes are distinguished from other microalgae by the presence of phycobiliproteins. The most abundant in Porphyridium are the phycoerythrins which give it this characteristic red color. Thanks to these phycoerythrins, red microalgae can live at a depth of up to 250 m.",
