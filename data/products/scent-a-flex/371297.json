    "description": "BCM Inks U.S.A. Nacreous Pearlescents inks offer a faux metallic characteristic when printed on clay coated or kraft substrate without the rub-off associated with true metallics. Varnishing is unnecessary for print protection; however, it will add additional gloss. These inks lend themselves to unique characteristics for RSC or POP packaging. Light colors and dark hues are possible in a transparent medium.",
