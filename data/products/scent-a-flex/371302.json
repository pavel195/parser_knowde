These specialized compounds can be printed directly onto corrugated packaging using existing equipment. It is cost effective and can be applied directly to the corrugated package to eliminate the need for a secondary converter (e.g., a label). BCM also supplies a line of security that makes authentication easy and non-compromising. Security features can be visible, invisible or a combination.",
