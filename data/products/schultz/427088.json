    "description": "Schultz速 380 is a liquid phase heat transfer fluid featured with outstanding high thermal stability. Compared to other super high-temperature heat transfer fluids, Schultz速 380 has a lower pour point, which decreases the cost of the system anti-freezing facility. Schultz速 380 is the same product as Therminol 72 and can be mixed together in any ratio.",
