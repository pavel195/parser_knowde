    "description": "LIFTONIN速-XPERT ECO is an intelligent collagen booster obtained from the leaf sap of the South African medical plant Bulbine frutescens. Smart skin collagen management is essential, because uncontrolled activation of collagen synthesis can lead to the induction of inflammatory processes and the development of low quality collagen. Thanks to the active substances knipholone and acetylated polymannose, LIFTONIN速-XPERT ECO recalibrates the equilibrium between the decomposition\nand reconstruction of dermal structures, thus providing the skin with an extra portion of high quality collagen.. LIFTONIN速- XPERT ECO is conform to COSMOS and Ecocert.",
