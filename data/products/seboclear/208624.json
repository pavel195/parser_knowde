    "description": "REFORCYL®-AION rejuvenates and purifies the skin by activating the key parameters of a healthy autophagy process: Golgi vesicle formation, mitochondrial fitness and LC3 gene upregulation.\nAutophagy is a natural cellular cleaning program. Degradation products are enveloped by vesicles, enzymatically upcycled and then reused. Impaired autophagy weakens the skin barrier and\npromotes skin “garb-aging”. \nClinical studies have shown that activating this form of cellular spring-cleaning markedly improves skin tone and leads to smooth, redensified skin.\nPumpkins from Styria, a region in Austria renowned for its healthy pumpkin seed oil, are used to produce REFORCYL®-AION.\nIt is carbon-neutral, conforms to the principles of a circular economy and provides for a holistic upcycling concept for skin, soul and our planet.",
