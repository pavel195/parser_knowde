    "description": "The majority of people rate their skin as sensitive or very sensitive. Many environmental factors irritate the skin. Variations in temperature, wind, physical and chemical effects and sunlight also contribute to irritation. The skin is exposed to various stress factors and is hardly ever at rest these days. Although the skin is generally very durable, it becomes increasingly sensitized or even damaged by all of the irritants.\nThe active ingredient DEFENSIL® has set new standards in its unique and effective care of sensitive skin.",
