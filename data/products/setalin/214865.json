    "description": "Optilith™ TRG A quickly reduces the initial tack without “destroying” the rheological properties of ink. Additionally, it flattens the tack curve through added solubility, providing greater tack stability and improved transfer. Optilith TRG A can be used in all oil based offset inks including heatset, sheetfed, web no-heat and other specialty lines.",
