    "description": "EB-142HT-1 is unfilled, low viscosity, high temperature resistant epoxy adhesive. It maintains high lap shear strength up to 210°C and has excellent thermal and chemical resistance. It can be used for bonding, coating, and sealing applications where a thin film with high insulating resistance is required, particularly at elevated temperatures. It is recommended for bonding metals, glass, and ceramic substrates.",
