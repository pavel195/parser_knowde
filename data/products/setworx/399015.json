    "description": "EPOXICAST-1006/EH-24 is a low viscosity, easily pourable, filled epoxy resin system featuring high thermal conductivity, good electrical insulation, and low shrinkage during cure. It is useful for potting and encapsulating components and modules where removal of heat and resistance to mechanical and thermal shock are prime considerations. The cured system provides excellent resistance to moisture, most organic solvents and inorganic chemicals.",
