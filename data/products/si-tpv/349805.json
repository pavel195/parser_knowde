    "description": "Chengdu Silike Technology SILIMER 5063 is long chain alkyl-modified siloxane masterbatch containing polar functional groups. It is mainly used in BOPP films, CPP films, pipes, pump dispensers and other products compatible with polypropylene. It can significantly improve anti-blocking &amp; smoothness of the film, and the lubrication during processing, can greatly reduce the film surface dynamic and static friction coefficient, make the film surface more smooth. At the same time, SILIMER 5063 has a special structure with good compatibility with the matrix resin, no precipitation, no sticky, and no effect on the transparency of film.",
