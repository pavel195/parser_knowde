    "description": "Silibase SR-6GS1 Resin Intermediate is an active intermediate of low molecular weight methoxy silicone resin, which is used for coil coating, electrical paint and other high temperature resistant products. It can also react with organic resin containing active hydroxyl group to form modified copolymer, improve heat resistance and weather resistance, etc. it can also synthesize a variety of silicone resins. It has the advantages of low viscosity, no solvent and convenient use. It can be used as a resin alone and can also modify other resins to increase heat resistance.",
