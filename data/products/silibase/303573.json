    "description": "Silibase SR-6202P MQ Silicone Resin is a very unique silicone high molecular polysiloxane compound with a tight spherical structure with a two-layer structure. Since the introduction of the vinyl group imparts excellent hydrosilylation properties, it has excellent heat resistance, film formability, adhesion, water repellency, aging resistance, and ultraviolet radiation resistance. SilibaseSR-6202P MQ Silicone Resin Powder can be used as a tackifier for silicone pressure sensitive adhesives, architectural sealants, organic resin coatings, etc., mobile phone buttons, epoxy adhesive bonding, etc.",
