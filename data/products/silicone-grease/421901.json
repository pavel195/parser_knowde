    "description": "Magnalube® Grease deposits a fine protective and lubricating film on metal parts. It is virtually unaffected by corrosive moisture and will not migrate from hot surfaces. Magnalube-G is water resistant, stable at high temperatures, resists oil separation, and is chemically and mechanically stable. The Teflon® base effectively lubricates at temperatures -40°C to 288°C. The applications are unlimited.",
