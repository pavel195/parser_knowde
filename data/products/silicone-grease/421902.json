    "description": "Silicone Grease® is used for applications with high temperatures up to +200°C. Our silicone based translucent grease is typically used for dielectric insulation, surface protection, release and specialized lubrication. It shows a very good resistance against tracking and corona discharge and makes surfaces resistant to water. In addition, it prevents that machined surfaces stick to gaskets and acts as electrical insulator.\r\n",
