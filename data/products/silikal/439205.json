    "description": "SILIKAL® R 61 resin is a reactive, slightly elasticized resin for slip-resistant floorings in wet areas. SILIKAL® R 61 resin is a solvent-free, medium-viscosity 2-component methacrylic resin of a slightly elasticized character. It is employed as a binder in the manufacture of self-leveling coatings sprinkled with quartz sand or for smoothable floorings with colored quartz, predominantly in the food industry (wet areas), in coat thickness of 2 - 3 mm or 4 - 6 mm. Hot water stress is limited to 60 °C. This limit may be briefly exceeded to 80 °C for cleaning purposes, but only if the floor is not completely warmed through.",
