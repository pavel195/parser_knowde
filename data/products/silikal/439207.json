    "description": "SILIKAL® RH 65 resin s a solvent free, fast curing MMA resin of very low viscosity. It is used for indoor screeds of 5-20 mm on concrete to equalize an uneven concrete surface. Screeds must be overlaid with a Silikal® coating system according to System A – E. The fast curing time of 1 hour, flexibility and filler rich formulation of 1 : 8 makes the mortar economical and can be applied at temperatures between 0°C and 35°C (refer to table of hardener). Hot water loadings must be limited to 60 °C. Excess temperature up to 80 °C will be accepted for a short moment as long as the temperature of the complete layer does not adopt the higher degree.",
