    "description": "SILIKAL® RV 368 resin is a solvent-free, 2-component methacrylic resin of high impact resistance and low-temperature fl exibility whose highly-molecular structure makes it outstandingly suitable for self-leveling coatings subject to extreme stresses, predominantly outdoors or for cold stores. Coatings made from SILIKAL® RV 368 resin are durably elastic and able to crack bridging.",
