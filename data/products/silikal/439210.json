    "description": "SILIKAL® R 71 resin (SILIKAL® R 71 re resin) is a reactive, solvent-free, low-viscosity and almost non-yellowing 2-component me thacrylic resin offering high hardness and good resistance to chemicals. The extremely low viscosity enhances the penetrative capacity of the resin in sand-sprinkled surfaces. Its high hardness guarantees outstanding resistance to chemicals.",
