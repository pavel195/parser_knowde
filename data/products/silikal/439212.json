    "description": "SILIKAL® R 82 resin is a reactive, solvent-free, low-viscosity, virtually non-yellowing 2-component methacrylic resin offering good resistance to water interaction. It serves primarily as a slightly elasticized and colorless top coat on sprinkled coatings in wet areas. The low viscosity enhances the penetrative capacity of the resin in sand-coated surfaces. Hot water stress is limited to +60 °C. The temperature stress may be increased to +80 °C for short periods, e. g. to allow cleaning, provided that the coating is not thoroughly warmed through to the substrate.",
