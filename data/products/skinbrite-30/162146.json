    "description": "L-Hexuron™ is a superior vitamin C derivative. It is very stable, and is easilyconverted to the active form by enzymes in the skin. The ethyl substituent forms an ether with the 3-hydroxyl group of the ascorbic acid, which results in much higher stability. L-Hexuron is amphiphilic which makes it compatible in a broad array of emulsion systems and clear lotions.",
