    "description": "T-Hexuron™ is a stable form of Vitamin C, more specifically, it is the tetra-ester of ascorbic acid and isopalmitic acid. T-Hexuron™ is oil-soluble, which means it not only penetrates the epidermis (the uppermost layer of your skin), but also goes farther into the dermis, the deeper layer—which is where it needs to be to stimulate collagen production. Finally, T-Hexuron™ is also known to clarify and brighten the skin by inhibiting melanogenesis (the production of pigment) thereby promoting a more even skin tone.\r\n",
