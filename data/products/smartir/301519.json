    "description": "Smartir™ uniquely combines the functionalities of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) to provide a low cost alternative to these pigments. By utilizing SmartIR in existing roof paint formulations, up to 50% of the TiO2 and all of the ZnO can be removed and replaced with much smaller quantities of SmartIR, all the while maintaining product performance.",
