    "description": "PEEKshrink® is a linear, semi–crystalline aromatic polymer, is considered one of the highest performing thermoplastic materials; it can withstand extreme temperatures, high pressure and caustic fluids. Now, Zeus has taken PEEK to an entirely new level of performance with PEEKshrink™. PEEKshrink™ provides a shrink-to-fit layer of protection for sensitive components and critical connections. PEEKshrink™ is an ideally suited product for challenging environments such as oil and gas exploration where abrasion, intense pressure, chemicals, water, or dielectric interference pose a threat to wires and electrical components. PEEKshrink™ is an obvious and optimal splicing aid for PEEK insulated wire. PEEKshrink™ is an alternative to traditional fluoropolymer protective coatings with its very wide working temperature range.",
