    "description": "\r\n\r\nOil Technics OT8 FC is a dual acting, powerful and biological solution that cleans oil contaminated floors and biologically digests its own rinse water. OT8 FC rapidly removes oil emulsions, enabling contaminated floors and surfaces to be rinsed clean. This natural eco-friendly solution breaks down even the most resistant grease, maintaining a floor that is truly deep cleaned. Rinse water is both emulsion free and biologically enhanced, enabling the bacteria and enzymes to signicantly reduce oil discharges to the environment. OT8 FC gives you industrial strength cleaning results without the hazards or toxic side effects of others products.\r\n",
