    "description": "SOLIMIDE速 AC-530 polyimide foam is utilized in aircraft, aerospace and industrial markets as a lightweight, non-wicking, thermal and acoustic insulation material where low fire, toxicity and smoke generation are critical. It is formaldehydefree and demonstrates excellent long term stability under humid conditions and after temperature cycling. SOLIMIDE速 AC-530 insulation is used in a variety of applications, including aircraft fuselage, under floor, ECS ducts and equipment, as well as expansion and contraction joints in cryogenic environments. The foam can be cut into numerous shapes and sizes, and is compatible with many different facings, coatings and adhesives to meet end-use requirements.\r\n",
