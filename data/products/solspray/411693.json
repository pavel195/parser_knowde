    "description": "SOLCOAT are hydroxypropylated starches available in different viscosities.The Solcoat products are used in paper production in the surface application as, for example, coating starch and surface sizing starch. The benefits of Solcoat are excellent binder characteristics, improved water retention as well as very good film forming properties. Solcoat make it possible  to reduce cost by replacing some parts of latex with Solcoat in coating formulations while maintaining printing characteristics. Solcoat can be used in top-coating as well as in pre-coating. Solcoat can also be used in different kinds of barriers. The Solcoat products have better storage stability than Solsize products. Solcoat products are available as cook-up starches",
