    "description": "SOLSIZE are cationic cook-up starches with DS from 0.02 to 0.03 available with different viscosities.They are oxidized cook-up starches available with different viscosities and raw materials. The Solsize products are used in paper production in the surface application as surface sizing starch or as coating starch. The benefits of Solsize in surface sizing are excellent printing characteristics of the ready paper and improved barrier properties such as oxygen and fat barrier. Solsize in coating application contributes to excellent binder characteristics and water retention. The excellent properties of Solsize make cost reduction possible by replacing some parts of latex in coating formulations with Solsize.",
