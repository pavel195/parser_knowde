    "description": "SONLOK® 3620 is a high viscosity; high strength anaerobic retaining compound for cylindrical fitting parts particularly where bond gaps can approach 0.25mm (0.01”). High temperature resistance up to 200°C. SONLOK® 3620 retaining compound is a single component anaerobic adhesive, which develops high strength rapidly when confined in the absence of air between close fitting metal surfaces.",
