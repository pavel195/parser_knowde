    "description": "SperseStab™ 6050 is formulated to provide UV protection to plasticized PVC as well as TPU, RIM, and urethane foam systems. As a liquid, it is easily incorporated and provides excellent weatherability and economy. It represents a lower-viscosity alternative to competitive products without the use of volatile organics. Use alone or in combination with other UV stabilizers or antioxidants. SperseStab™ 6050 is a 100% active liquid UV stabilizer system designed for use in coatings and systems where acids may be present. Based on a N-OR HALS and synergistic UV absorbers, the system is tolerant of acids and is ideal for PVC, acrylics, and alkyd-based coatings. SperseStab™ 6050 can also be used in liquid color/additive masterbatches and candles.",
