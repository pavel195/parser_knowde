    "description": "Silver Coated Cenospheres uses a patented and proprietary process of wet chemistry to coat cenospheres with a thin layer of silver that allowed the finished product to perform like silver in electrical conduction and infra-red (IR) reflection AND simultaneously perform like a ceramic in thermal insulation, low cost, low maintenance and ease of use. Silver Coated Cenospheres from Ceno Technologies are extremely reflective and can exhibit an EMI shielding effectiveness of 60dB from 100 MHz to 25 GHz and higher.",
