    "description": "Ceno Technolgies ALAG 450 Powder deposits precisely controlled amounts of sliver (and other metals including gold, palladium, iridium, etc.) onto nanoparticles, thus producing highly reflective materials with the conductivity of the precious metals but without the high cost or weight. Further research has resulted in materials which can absorb electromagnetic energy instead of simply reflecting it. Please contact us directly for further details and recommendations.",
