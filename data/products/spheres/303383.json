    "description": "SPHERES CTB350 is clean and graded cenospheres which have unusually high compressive strength and can easily handle pressures of 4,000 psi without breakage. This immense strength extends their versatility by providing increased breakage resistance during mixing, processing and application. Their light gray color consistency will always give you the results you expect, as well as delivering lower tint costs.",
