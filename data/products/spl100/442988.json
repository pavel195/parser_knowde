    "description": "Prolong® Ultra Cut 1 is a water-soluble cutting fluid that has proven to maximize results in sawing, grinding, boring, turning or milling processes where coolants are required. It is extremely effective in eliminating uneven cuts and increasing tool life beyond the industry’s standard expectations. It is excellent as a flood coolant, and for making emulsions in machine shops where a coolant lubricant is required.",
