    "description": "Contec® NeutraKlean is a non-foaming, gentle detergent designed for cleaning life science cleanrooms. Contec NeutraKlean, with a pH of 6.5 to 8.0 after irradiation, is ideal for performing low-level cleaning after maintenance, as well as removing disinfectant residues and general soil. The use of a surfactant/detergent aids in the release of particles and dirt from a surface, allowing them to be more easily removed.",
