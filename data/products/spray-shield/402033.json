    "description": "STEEL SHIELD Extreme Pressure Anti-Wear (EPAW)™ is the ultimate protection for the moving metal parts for industry. Utilizing the most Advanced Boundary Film (ABF) Technology, it protects moving metal parts from heat, friction and wear in engines, transmissions, differentials, transfer cases, hydraulic pumps and motors, gear boxes, and other enclosed lubrication systems, due to boundary conditions of frictional abrasion, extreme pressure torque, dry startup and shutdown. Increased performance and greatly reduced maintenance and downtime are the results. These performance goals are achieved through ABF Technology by lowering the operating temperatures, extending the life of component parts and increasing reliability.",
