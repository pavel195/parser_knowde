    "description": "FUEL SHIELD™ is the ultimate fuel system performance enhancer and fuel lubricity improver. Utilizing the most Advanced Boundary Film (ABF) Technology,it provides maximum lubrication in gasoline and diesel fuel systems. Fuel Shield™ is especially formulated to help protect against accelerated wear caused from Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuels. Fuel Shield thoroughly cleans the entire fuel system while reducing emissions, increasing fuel mileage, improving power, performance, in addition to extending the life of fuel injectors, injection pumps and fuel filter life. Other benefits include the elimination of gum and resin deposits, increased fuel combustion efficiency, improved fuel atomization, removes water and fights corrosion in the fuel system.",
