    "description": "Versagel® MN 1600 is anhydrous clear gels that provide versatility and a distinctive, elegant feel. The polymer system provides lubricity and conditioning, while the ester base, isononyl isononanoate, offers non-greasy emolliency. Due to the polymer matrix in the gel, these materials enable fine particles, such as color pigments, to be readily suspended or dispersed with minimal settling and agglomeration. Versagel MN products also exhibit good thermal and UV stability and silicone solubilization. Depending on the application, the suggested use level may range from 5% to 60%. Versagel MN gels should be blended with the rest of the ingredients in the oil phase of the formulation, while the nonpolar or less polar ingredients are added to the gel first. The gels are compatible with most nonionic surfactants, cyclomethicone, phenyl trimethicone, and other synthetic and natural emollients.",
