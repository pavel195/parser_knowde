    "description": "STAR-POL® 136 Starch Polymer is an easily dispersible, highly substituted, nonionic water soluble polymer designed to be used at lower solids levels in wall treatments, adhesives, tile mortar, tile grout, oil drilling mud as well as a number of other applications. STAR-POL® 136 is a modified waxy corn based starch polymer. Pregelatinization allows the polymer to hydrate and build high viscosity in water at low temperatures. The STAR-POL® 136 polymer is modified to give enhanced water holding capacity which allows this product to serve as an excellent fluid loss control agent. In addition, STAR-POL® 136 is also crosslinked to provide resistance to shear breakdown.",
