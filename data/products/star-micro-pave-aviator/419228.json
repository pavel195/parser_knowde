    "description": "STAR MICRO-PAVE AVIATOR® is designed as a premium grade, Asphalt Emulsion (water based) sealcoating that is superior to other conventional mix design sealers. STAR MICRO-PAVE AVIATOR®, as supplied, contains the necessary amount of rubber similar to that specified by the FAA for airfield maintenance. The rubber is “Hot Blended” during the manufacturing process to ensure it is properly fused into the asphalt binder. Cold mixing simply does not achieve the same level of bonding to the asphalt binder particles. The superiority of STAR MICRO-PAVE AVIATOR® has been well established in the field for nearly two decades. STAR MICRO-PAVE AVIATOR® has toughness and flexibility at all temperatures as well as resistance to many chemicals and de-icing salts.",
