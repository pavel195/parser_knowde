STAR® GENESIS PRIME RT™ is a water based, 100% acrylic polymer coating that is fortified with specialty chemicals that will promote adhesion to problematic areas in both asphalt and concrete pavements. STAR® GENESIS PRIME RT™ is the FIRST product you should look to when you encounter a challenging adhesion situation over problematic surfaces that need to be sealcoated. STAR® GENESIS PRIME RT™ overcomes the common problems faced every day when working to cover surfaces that have been contaminated by oils, grease, fats, tree sap deposits, fuel spillage and anti-freeze drippings. Also highly effective in priming aged pavements and polished aggregates, freshly patched asphalt areas and concrete pavements that are difficult for sealcoatings to adhere to.",
