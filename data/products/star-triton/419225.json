    "description": "STAR® S.O.S. SEALER™ is a latex based coating/primer that adheres to, and seals, oil and grease spots on all types of asphalt pavements. The polymeric matrix and surfactants in STAR® S.O.S. SEALER™ create a tough film that bonds aggressively to the contaminated area. STAR® S.O.S. SEALER™ will allow both Asphalt Emulsion and Refined Tar sealers to bond properly these freshly primed areas. STAR® S.O.S. SEALER™ will eliminate the need for excessive surface preparation that could damage the asphalt substrate.",
