    "description": "Pure fungal Alpha-amylase for starch decomposition, with excellent activity also at low pH. The Alpha-amylase splits unbranched sections of the starch molecule into smaller components. It only acts on dissolved substrate, i. e. Swollen, damaged starch in the dough or slurry, or on starch that has been thermally modified (pre-gelatinized).",
