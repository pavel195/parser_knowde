    "description": "FruSweet® - Non-GMO Crystalline Fructose is 1.75+ times sweeter than sugar, so you can use about half as much. With only 4.2 carbs per serving and a low glycemic impact compared to table sugar, FruSweet presents as a versatile pantry workhorse.  Since it browns and caramelizes when baking, and dissolves easily in hot or cold beverages, it will quickly become a favorite in the kitchen. Deliciously sweet and simple, our FruSweet is comprised of 100% Non-GMO crystalline fructose. Perfect for cooks looking for browning when they bake, and for those seeking a great tasting, low glycemic sweetener.",
