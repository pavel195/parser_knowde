    "description": "Pomalux® SD-A is non-carbon-filled, non-migratory, permanently antistatic acetal co-polymer offering surface resistivity of 109 – 1011 ohms/sq which is non-humidity dependent. Natural in color, this material offers enhanced lubricity, provides superior wear resistance, and ease of machining. Exhibiting low outgassing and non-sloughing characteristics, it is optimal for ESD applications where carbon sloughing cannot be accepted.",
