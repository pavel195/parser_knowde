    "description": "EZ-Blox® optimizes the performance of alkyd-based paint and coating formulations by preventing surface skin formation due to contact with atmospheric oxygen when, between uses, such formulations sit in containers. EZ-Blox® is a breakthrough product that offers a safe, cost-effective replacement for MEKO, typically with equal efficacy and compatibility with other components in such formulations. With EU-REACH certification and low-toxicity, EZ-Blox® is ideal for paints and coatings producers looking to reformulate high-performance alkyd-based systems post ECHA’s reclassification of MEKO as a Carcinogen 1B substance on March 1, 2022.",
