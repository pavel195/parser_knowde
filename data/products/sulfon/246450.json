    "description": "Soluble Base 5100 is a formulated soluble oil emulsifier package specifically designed to emulsify naphthenic oils typically with aniline points of 155°F to 175°F. Its good hard water stability and rust inhibiting characteristics make this product an excellent choice for formulating soluble oils and semi-synthetic fluids used in machining, grinding, and forming operations. Soluble Base 5100 offers good rust inhibiting and emulsification properties at addition levels of 15 to 25% concentrations in oil.",
