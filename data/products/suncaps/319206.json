    "description": "CelluCap™ C is a highly effective encapsulation of ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate, which helps to overcome common formulation challenges associated with vitamin C. By isolating this oil-soluble vitamin C derivative, formulations are less likely to show discoloration and deterioration of the raw material. It is as if each microdose of ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate is delivered in its own airtight packaging. CelluCap™ C exhibits Tagra's Release on Demand (RND) technology, which releases the ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate only upon mechanical application. The cellulose-based shell collapses, releasing the active while breaking down into invisible particles. These particles retain some of the core ingredients, creating extended delivery for continued efficacy.",
