    "description": "CelluCap™ Resveratrol is a microencapsulated delivery system that effectively overcomes the formulation challenges associated with resveratrol, such as discoloration and recrystallization. The encapsulation of resveratrol in a cellulose-based shell provides stability, extending the potency of the material and ensuring its freshness until the moment of application. In addition, the encapsulated resveratrol is easily released upon mechanical pressure, such as through rubbing action. The single-layer polymeric shell collapses and breaks down into invisible particles while still retaining the payload to deliver over time. This enables efficient delivery of resveratrol to the skin, resulting in extended antioxidant activity and anti-aging benefits. Moreover, CelluCap™ Resveratrol is globally compliant, making it suitable for use in a variety of skincare products worldwide. Clinically tested, CelluCap™ Resveratrol is a promising ingredient in the beauty industry, offering potent anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits.",
