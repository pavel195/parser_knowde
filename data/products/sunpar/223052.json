    "description": "Natrochem TBEP DLC-A is blend of tributoxyethyl phosphate and silicon-dioxide. Provides very low temperature flexibility to plastics and acrylonitrile elastomers. Used as a plasticizer and a flame retardant in adhesives. It may retard cure with large loadings. Incorporates rapidly; aids filler dispersion; and reduces pigment requirements in colored stocks.",
