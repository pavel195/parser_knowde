    "description": "Trilene 65 DLC-A is a free-flowing powder made by combining Trilene liquid polymer and silicon dioxide. The blend is nominally 68% EPDM polymer and 32% silica. It is available as a dry, free-flowing powder that is easy to measure, store and transfer. DLC incorporates quickly and thoroughly into various elastomer systems, and gives quality and processing advantages when compared to neat polymer. Trilene 65 DLC-A is effective in EPDM, BR, NR, SBR and other elastomers.",
