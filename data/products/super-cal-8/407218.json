    "description": "SSP™ helps to trans locate air and water movement in your soil. SSP™ will aid to loosen compacted soil and to break up hard pan. This is not a wetting agent that works on standing water only. Wetting agents change the standing water characteristics to break down in size to seep through small cracks in the soil. SSP™ actually works on the soil itself, creating a layer around the soil colloid, helping it separate from the other soil particles. Once soil is treated with SSP™, it will hold it physical characteristics even during the next big rain.",
