    "description": "HOT ROCK™ Bulk Extreme is produced by treating bulk HOT ROCK with a proprietary blend of hot liquid chlorides, organic additives, and green color. This allows the salt to perform during the most extreme weather conditions. Bulk HOT ROCK Extreme is effective at melting ice and snow at -20 degrees. Our organic additives produce residual melting power that stays on the ground’s surface even after the ice, snow, and salt are gone. This allows for customers to use less salt for future applications as winter progresses.",
