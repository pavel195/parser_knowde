    "description": "Super SAP® CLR/CLF is our flagship, high-performance, clear-coating epoxy system. A Super Sap® Formulation, the CLR system is a water-clear, UV-stabilized epoxy system for laminations and coatings that require a low-color, low-yellowing epoxy such as high-colorwork applications. This system features a quick air-release and world-class UV resistance package. CLR works with multiple hardeners to match your working parameters. It has an ideal viscosity for a wide range of applications that use hand layup techniques with fast, room-temperature cures.",
