    "description": "AlbaChem®1S/2P Ink &amp; Stencil Remover is ink and emulsion in one step. 1S/2P can be used directly on the screen or in a dip tank. Solvent ink and acidic emulsion removers are generally incompatible which is why most 2 in 1 product have a very limited shelf life. Alba-Chem 1S/2P comes in two parts that are mixed together when ready to be used. This maintains the strength and extends the effectiveness of the product. 1S/2P saves time, money, and reduces chemical inventory in the shop.",
