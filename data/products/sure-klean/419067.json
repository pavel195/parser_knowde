    "description": "Sure Klean® 800 Stain Remover is a specialty masonry cleaning product that effectively removes green vanadium stains commonly found in buff or white brick. Sure Klean® 800 Stain Remover also removes straw stains, acid burns and other metallic discolorations from most masonry surfaces. Many staining conditions are created by excessive moisture in the walls. To avoid this, protect open wall cavities from rainwater during construction and correct any structural problems that allow water to enter the walls.",
