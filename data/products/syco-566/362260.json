    "description": "SYCO 721® is the noblest additive in the line, has high anti-foaming and de-foaming power and allows the use of low dosage, due to its high efficiency compared to classic emulsified mineral oil. It reduces the amount of splashes in the application, inhibits the formation of craters and provides excellent long-term stability, as it presents particles that do not emulsify in the system.",
