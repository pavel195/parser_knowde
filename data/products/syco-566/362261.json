    "description": "SYCO 730®, in addition to having high anti-foaming power, promotes a de-foaming effect in the manufacturing process, superior to the traditional mineral oil-based market. It also reduces the amount of splashes in the application, inhibits the formation of craters, it has low interference on the final product’s gloss and wet abrasion resistance, in addition to providing excellent long-term stability of the final product, as it presents particles that do not emulsify in the system.",
