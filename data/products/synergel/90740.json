Versagel MG offers an alternative to silicones for formulating products when a silky, elegant after-feel is desired. Versagel MG gels are compatible with most ingredients, with most non-ionic surfactants, and other synthetic and natural emollients. A unique property of the Versagel product lines is their suspension capability for fine particles.
