    "description": "SYNPRINT AC 6111 is a modified water-based acrylic copolymer that combines two different ionic structures in the same interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). This technology allows the formulator to take advantage of a cationic acrylic without the traditional compatibility issues as it can be formulated like a conventional anionic water-based acrylate. This unusual combination provides excellent adhesion to a wide range of difficult substrates. SYNPRINT AC 6111 forms tough flexible films with excellent dry wrinkle behavior.",
