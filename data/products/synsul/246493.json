    "description": "K-Ox™ 9100 is a barium free non-staining, non-emulsifiable, alkali resistant, water displacing and water separating rust preventive concentrate which is soluble in aliphatic and aromatic solvents, naphthenic and paraffinic oils, and a selection of natural oils. K-Ox™ 9100 is particularly effective in displacing water from metal parts after machining operations or alkali cleaning. K-Ox™ 9100 will deposit an ultra-thin oily or waxy film, depending upon the diluent used. K-Ox™ 9100 will provide excellent humidity resistance and provide limited protection in salt environments and acid atmospheres.",
