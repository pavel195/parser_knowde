    "description": "SYNTRAN速 PUC 6225 is a cationic, waterborne, one-component, polyester-like, aliphatic polyurethane dispersion with excellent compatibility and good adhesion to metal and inorganic substrates, pigments and functional plastics such as polycarbonate. It has excellent corrosion resistance on cold-rolled sheet metal. It is a self-emulsifying, one-component system that shows no migration characteristics because it contains no surfactants. It is the hard version of SYNTRAN速 PUC 6224 and can be used together with cationic acrylates on steel coil. Formulations based on SYNTRAN速 PUC 6225 for various applications are available on request.\r\n\r\nFeatures and Benefits:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tExcellent corrosion resistance\r\n\tExcellent chemical resistance\r\n\tExcellent compatibility/adhesion to pigments and inorganic fillers\r\n\tGood adhesion\r\n\tHigh gloss\r\n\tExcellent scratch and abrasion resistance\r\n\tGood weather resistance\r\n\r\n",
