    "description": "Vector® 2336A styrenic block copolymer is a radial block copolymer with a narrow molecular weight distribution. It is well-suited for use as a modifier in construction applications. It is the same polymer as Vector 2336, but unlike Vector 2336, Vector 2336A does not contain the antioxidant tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite (TNPP).",
