    "description": "Technicure® PDU-250M, N,N-dimethyl-N-phenyl urea, is a substituted urea. It is used as a dicyandiamide (DICY) accelerator in one-component epoxy resin based formulations. Typically the product is used with epoxy resin and dicyandiamide between 1-3 phr. The loading level of an accelerator will provide balance of low temperature reactivity and formulation shelf stability.",
