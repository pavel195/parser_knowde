    "description": "Tallicin® 4200 decreases the porosity of unsaturated polyesters and provides a smooth, level finish to the surface. It also eliminates the effects of craters and \"orange peel.\" Tallicin® 4200 is also useful in overcoming bubbles in other types of high solids formulations and acts to improve flow and leveling in these systems.",
