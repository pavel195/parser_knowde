    "description": "Aiflooring LV BaseCoat is designed to be used as a basecoat for the TerraChip System. It has a lower viscosity than standard TC Basecoat for easier handling, especially in cooler temperatures. Scrape times for the LV Basecoat can be adjusted by using one, or a blend, of the 3 BaseCoat hardeners- Standard, Redline, and Infrared. LV BaseCoat is a two component 100% solids epoxy.",
