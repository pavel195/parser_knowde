    "description": "Terrazzco® Terrazzco Moisture Mitigation System MMS 950 is a VOC free 2 component epoxy resin system cured with an amine curing agent and applied on the top surface of concrete slabs providing a retarder against moisture vapor transmission for slabs having a relative humidity of 70-95%. The product is mixed and applied onto the top surface of the concrete soaking into and sealing the pored while it builds a thin film layer approximately 6 mils on the surface. MMS 950 yields approximately 300 – 400 square feet per mixed unit. Coverage is based on the porosity of the concrete and may require a second application for very porous surfaces.",
