    "description": "The Nano-Ag Answer™ is a unique fertilizer and soil conditioner that becomes one with the soil at a cellular level through Nature’s biological system of nano-life processes, to help rejuvenate the natural nutrients that are essential for healthy soil and healthy plants. The traditional use of manure and compost for adding ‘fertility’ back into soil through the help of ‘Nature’s Army’ of macro- and microbial activity, is as old as ‘agriculture’ itself; augmenting the soil with chemically produced products based on the nitrogen-phosphorus and potassium (NPK) theory is fairly recent and has brought with it major health and environmental problems. Though meeting government NPK requirements as a ‘fertilizer’ for all agriculture, The Nano-Ag Answer™ is Listed by the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) as meeting the USDA-National Organic Program (USDA-NOP) for use in Certified Organic® production and processing.",
