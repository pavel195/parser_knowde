    "description": "The Mineral-Electrolyte Answer™ water-soluble trace minerals derived from nature’s bounty of humic material, is a bio-chemical solution for helping regulate, restore and balance the electric life to each individual cell providing them the essential energy they need to survive and function at full potential. It contains organic electrolytes (fulvic acid), essential micronutrients, trace minerals, chelated minerals and nutrients in bioavailable form, serves as an outside electrical force. The Mineral-Electrolyte Answer™ stimulates microbial activity in soil. It can mimic functions of some plant growth regulators when applied properly, chelates minerals and other soil nutrients, enhancing their availability for plants. It reduces compaction and increases oxygen in soil by improving soil tilth. The Mineral-Electrolyte Answer™ helps water penetrate and permeate plant cells, assisting nutrient uptake and water storage during drought conditions, as well as balance water and assisting plant transpiration, the transport of water and nutrients of the cell tissues.",
