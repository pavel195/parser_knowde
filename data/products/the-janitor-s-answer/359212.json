    "description": "The Janitor's Answer™ excels in the effective cleaning of all hard nonporous surfaces including polyurethane floors, tile, linoleum, vinyl or finished wood. This formula contains no sulfonates, phosphates, caustics, NTA or other pollutnants and cleans without leaving anything behind - like harsh chemical fumes. The Janitor's Answer™ is a cleaner produced from alkaline water, manufactured by the WRJ-Ag-ROX EO Water Equipment, with a proprietary blend of surfactants, that takes the place of a wide range of harsh chemical cleaners. It is clear and nearly odorless, non-staining, non-flammable, and non-toxic. Extremely versatile, it can be used in hard, soft and salt water, and works well even in cold water. The Janitor's Answer™ is 100% biodegradable in the environment in the optimum desirable time of 7 days. Substances that biodegrade too quickly are considered “bio-stimulants” and pollutants as cleaners: Substances that biodegrade in excess of 7 days are classified as “hard” chemicals and are hazardous to human health.",
