    "description": "Thermaguard™ CUI 650 is a third generation, pure inorganic single component, ambient curing polysiloxane coating formulated specifically to provide corrosion protection to under insulation environments where wet & dry cycling can occur. The coating conforms to the NACE SP0198-2017 classification, inert multi polymeric matrix coatings for Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) in both cryogenic & elevated temperature applications. Through specific formulation technology Thermaguard™ CUI 650 can withstand temperatures from -196 to 650°C, fully curing at ambient conditions eliminating the need for heat curing prior to service. Thermaguard™ CUI 650 has exceptional resistance to thermal cycling, hot saline water immersion & chemical exposure throughout its operating temperature range. \nThermaguard™ CUI 650 can be used in both OEM (shop application) & maintenance work due to having surface tolerance to rusted steels which have been marginally prepared (St 2/3). Additionally, the product can be applied in service to hot equipment operating up to 260oC, removing the need for plant shut down periods.",
