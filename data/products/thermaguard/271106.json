    "description": "Thermaguard™ TIC 180 is a waterbased, single component, Thermal Insulation Coating (TIC), formulated to provide a seamless weather resistant insulation film which can improve energy efficiency, prevent Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) occurring, reduce condensation build up & provide personal protection according to ISO 13732-1.\nThe insulation coating acts as a thermal barrier, protecting interior temperatures against cold, warm & humid weather conditions. Can be easily implemented into an inspection program due to the elimination of external cladding therefore, offering a maintenance friendly insulation coating system.",
