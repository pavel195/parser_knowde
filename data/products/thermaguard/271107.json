    "description": "Thermaguard™ TIC 400 is a new technology waterbased, single component, inorganic polymeric siloxane matrix, Thermal Insulation Coating (TIC). The insulation coating is formulated to provide a seamless, hydrophobic, weather resistant insulation film. The insulation coating is an inorganic & ultra-low VOC coating. Offering hydrophobicity (moisture resistance), operating temperatures from -60 to 400oC range & exceptional weathering resistance. \nThermaguard™ TIC 400 acts as a thermal barrier, which can improve energy efficiency, prevent Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) occurring, reduce condensation build up & provide personal protection according to ISO 13732-1 (SafeTouch™ properties). Protecting interior temperatures against cold, warm & humid weather conditions. Elimination of external cladding results in a maintenance friendly insulation system for quick inspections. \nThermaguard™ TIC 400 has Ultra-High-Build (UHB) capabilities up to 20000 microns DFT in a single multi-pass application. Application at such thicknesses allows use of Thermaguard™ TIC 400 liquid insulation to partly or completely replace use of traditional insulation material systems.",
