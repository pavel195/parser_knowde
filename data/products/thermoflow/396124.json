    "description": "Muehlmeier E-glass mat E-CSM - powder bonded E-CSM 225 consists of cut and non-orientated E-glass strands which have silane size. The binding of the strands amongst each other happens by a powder mat binder on polyester base which is easily soluble in styrene. Working happens in the well-known contact â€“ or continuous processes. The mat is suitable for UP, EP and vinyl ester resins.",
