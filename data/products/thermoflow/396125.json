    "description": "Muehlmeier E-CR glass mat - powder bonded consists of cut and non-oriented E-CR glass strands which have silane size. The binding of the strands amongst each other happens by a powder mat binder on polyester base which is easily soluble in styrene. Working happens in the well-known contact- and continuous processes. The mat is suitable for UP, EP and vinyl ester resins. Compared to E-glass E-CR glass has excellent resistance against chemical and thermal influences and also a higher dielectric strength.",
