    "description": "Muehlmeier E-Glass - emulsion bonded E-CSM 225 consists of cut and non-oriented e-glass strands which have silane size. The binding of the strands amongst each other happens by a liquid mat binder on PVAc base which is easily soluble in styrene. Working happens in the well-known contact- or continuous processes. The mat is suitable for UP, EP and vinyl ester resins.",
