    "description": "StarRov® E-glass direct roving PR 80 300 076 is drawn directly from the glass melting and wound to a roving bobbin without turn. It is characterized by a soft silane size that is especially recommended for weaving process or the production of cores, especially multiaxial fabrics. The direct roving 076 has a good impregnation with polyester, epoxy and vinyl ester resins, low wear and guarantees high mechanical strength of the final product.",
