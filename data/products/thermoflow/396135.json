    "description": "StarRov® E-glass roving 254 - assembled EC15 2400 254 (45) is wound to a roving bobbin (assembled) by consistent stress wound strands. The recommended field of application is the production of SMC moldings (sheet molding compound). The strong silane size guarantees a good cutting ability and dispersion in its single fibers. The size is optimal adjusted to the working with unsaturated polyester resins.",
