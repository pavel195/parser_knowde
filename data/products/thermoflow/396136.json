    "description": "Muehlmeier E-CR glass - direct roving E-CR300 is drawn directly from the glass melting and wound to a roving bobbin without turn. It is characterized by a soft silane size that is especially recommended for winding and pultrusion. The silane size was optimized for the working with polyester, epoxy, phenol and vinyl ester resins. Compared to E-glass, E-CR glass has excellent chemical and thermal resistance and higher dielectric strength. Therefore the preferred uses are installations and containers for the chemical industry.",
