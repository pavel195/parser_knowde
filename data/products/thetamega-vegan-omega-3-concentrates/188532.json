    "description": "alphamega³ 400 MT Vegan Algal DHA Oil is extracted from the marine algae, Schizochytrium sp., in an aqueous-based, chemical-free process. The resulting oil is then further processed to meet strict sensory and quality parameters. The resultant product is a high quality, fully winterized algal oil (clear at room temperature), with minimal taste and odor. alphamega³ 400 MT contains 40% DHA (400mg/g) and mixed tocopherols. alphamega³ 400 MT is an ideal ingredient for brands seeking a clean-label Omega-3 ingredient, and is Organic Compliant. alphamega³ 400 MT is most commonly used in infant and early childhood nutrition applications, dietary supplements, functional foods and beverages and plant-based meat alternatives where manufacturers want the nutritional benefits of plant-derived Omega-3 DHA without an underlying marine smell or taste.",
