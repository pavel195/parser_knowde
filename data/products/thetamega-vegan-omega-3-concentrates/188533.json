    "description": "alphamega³ 400 3AOX Vegan Algal DHA Oil is extracted from the marine algae, Schizochytrium sp., in an aqueous-based, chemical-free process. The resulting oil is then further processed to meet strict sensory and quality parameters. The resultant product is a high quality, fully winterized algal oil (clear at room temperature), with minimal taste and odor. alphamega³ 400 3AOX contains 40% DHA (400mg/g), mixed tocopherols, rosemary extract, and ascorbyl palmitate. Due to a robust anti-oxidant blend, alphamega³ 400 3AOX is our most versatile and forgiving liquid ingredient. alphamega³ 400 3AOX is most commonly used in dietary supplements, plant-based meat alternatives, functional foods and beverages and novel applications where manufacturers want the nutritional benefits of plant-derived Omega-3 DHA without an underlying marine smell or taste.",
