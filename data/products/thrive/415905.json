    "description": "THRIVE® HP-II ISO 32 is a advanced formula with long life and anti-wear hydraulic fluids. They are designed for high performance hydraulic systems operating under extreme conditions. HP-II High Performance Hydraulic Oils are formulated with superior Group II crystal clear base oils processed to 99.9% purity. By removing impurities that can hinder the performance of competitive conventional oils, and blending in our specialty additives, HP-II High Performance Hydraulic Oils retain their “fresh oil” properties longer, providing resistance to oxidative breakdown and superior wear protection. The use of Group II base stocks typically increases the D 943 oxidation performance to exceed 5,000 hours. HP-II High Performance Hydraulic Oils take your equipment to higher levels of performance.",
