    "description": "Thurmalox® 884-090 Blue is a heat-resistant modified silicone coating designed primarily for temperature indicating applications requiring a single stage irreversible color change. When applied to refinery and petrochemical process equipment which operate at elevated temperatures the color change provided by Thurmalox 884-090 indicates vessel overheating due to failure of refractory linings, system malfunction or bypassing of hot gasses. Thurmalox 884-090 is suitable for maximum continuous operating temperatures up to 500°F (260°C).",
