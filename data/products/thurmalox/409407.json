    "description": "Apexior® Number 1C is a VOC compliant, single component, easy to apply air dry coating specifically formulated for the hot water-side corrosion prevention of metal surfaces. It is a coating that excels in severe thermal cyclic immersion service. Apexior Number 1C is resistant to continuous immersion in boiling water and steam from 200°F to 700°F (371°C). It aids in the reduction and prevention of tight bonding of hard scale and allows for easy cleaning and removal of any scale buildup in steam generating equipment. Apexior Number 1C prevents pitting corrosion and stops corrosion that has already begun - except for badly pitted areas. It has outstanding wetting properties and adheres well to power tooled cleaned areas. Equipment coated with Apexior Number 1C will also see an increase in heat transfer efficiency. Apexior Number 1C performs ideally with water treatment in steam generating equipment.",
