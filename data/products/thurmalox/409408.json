    "description": "Apexior速 Number 3速 is a single component, easy to apply air cure coating specifically formulated for the waterside corrosion prevention of metal surfaces. It has outstanding wetting properties and adheres well to power-tooled cleaned areas. Apexior Number 3 is resistant to continuous immersion in fresh or salt water as well as frequently wet or high humidity environments. Apexior Number 3 prevents pitting corrosion and stops corrosion which has already begun - except for badly pitted areas. It aids in the reduction and prevention of tight bonding of hard scale and allows for easy cleaning and removal of scale buildup. Apexior Number 3 performs ideally with water treatment.",
