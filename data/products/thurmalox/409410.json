    "description": "Elastoid™ 1300 is a single-package, high-build, elastomeric coating and vapor barrier. It is formulated from multiphase synthetic rubber copolymers which interact to provide an unusual range of desirable chemical and physical properties. It is tough, flexible, and corrosion-resistant and provides heavy-duty, long-term protection in highly aggressive chemical, industrial and marine environments. It has extremely low gas, water and water vapor permeability, and exhibits one of the lowest water vapor transmission rates possible with an elastomeric system. It is virtually unaffected by water immersion.",
