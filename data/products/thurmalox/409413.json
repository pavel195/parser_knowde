When properly applied the coating converts the rusted surface to a dark, stable organic iron compound. This product has a low permeability factor and is impermeable to oxygen and moisture while providing a rust-free surface ready for priming or finish painting It converts and primes rusted surfaces in one operation; dries to a hard, gloss finish combines excellent flexibility, toughness and impact resistance.",
