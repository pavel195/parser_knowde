    "description": "Tipaque® A-100 is a non-coated anatase type titanium dioxide pigment produced by the sulfate process. It has a more blueish color tone and higher brightness because of its high reflectance of short wavelength light in visible region, compared to rutile type titanium dioxide.\nTipaque® A-100 has a more blueish tinted tone because of smaller particle size compared to rutile type titanium dioxide. It is suitable grade for versatile applications such as plastics ( e.g. PVC), rubber and traffic paints.",
