    "description": "Tipaque® PFR209 is medium particle size rutile type titanium dioxide pigment produced by the sulfate process and surface-treated with silica and alumina. It is suitable grade for lamination gravure ink and shows good performance for ink film properties and printing properties.\nTipaque® PFR209 shows superior opacity even after lamination due to the improvement dispersion in ink films, namely superior light scattering with the control of coarse particles.",
