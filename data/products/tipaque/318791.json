    "description": "Tipaque® PF-742 is a medium-particle-size rutile type titanium dioxide pigment produced by the sulfate process and post-treated with silica, alumina and organic compound. TIPAQUEⓇ PF-742 is special grade for laminate type gravure ink, and has excellent printing properties. Tipaque® PF-742 shows higher hiding power even after lamination due to the creative silica treatment in spite of relatively lower amount of surface treatment and it has excellent lamination properties such as adhesivity and excellent re-resolvability.",
