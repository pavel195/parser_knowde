    "description": "Processed cheese is the perfect match â€“ an excellent ingredient with real versatility. Convenience food is becoming more popular and consumers and manufacturers alike are increasingly demanding regarding the characteristics of the products they eat. They are looking for functional products that provide different physical attributes i.e. melt quality, gratability and sliceability. Having undergone heat treatment, it has a stable shelf-life, which gives excellent microbiological parameters. It also guarantees good physical characteristics in comparison with natural cheese which can deteriorate quicker over time.\r\n",
