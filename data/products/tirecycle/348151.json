    "description": "Norst® PB-402-24 is a highly modified polyisobutylene polymer that exhibits high tack and cold flow over a very wide temperature range (-70°F to 450°F, with variants stable to 650°F and 800°F). It is impermeable to water or oxygen. It has good tensile and bond strength, high film strength, permanent tackiness, excellent aging/weather resistance, low stain, low electrical conductivity. It is odorless, colorless, and highly stable. Chemical resistance is comparable to other polyisobutylene polymers. PB-402-24 can be used as a high performance additive in any non-aqueous system where high tack and elasticity are needed.",
