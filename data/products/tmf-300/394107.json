    "description": "Mar-Con速 600 Polycarbonate is an advanced technology abrasion resistant highly cross-linked hard coating with excellent abrasion resistance, solvent resistance, and antigraffiti properties. It is designed for a variety of high-performance end uses. This Mar-Con 600 hard coating provides enhanced resistance to abrasion of the sheet surfaces from cleaning, handling, and defacement efforts. Mar-Con速 600 Polycarbonate plastic substrate is a high optic grade polycarbonate that exhibits excellent optical properties with superior impact resistance and flame spread properties. This product can be used in many more applications than would be practical for an uncoated polycarbonate sheet. Mar-Con 600 can also be applied to thin gage materials without suffering from distortions caused by typical thermal curing coating processes.",
