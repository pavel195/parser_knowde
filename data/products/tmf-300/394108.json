    "description": "Mar-Con® 551 Polycarbonate (Forming Grade) is an abrasion resistant plastic sheet product designed for a variety of high performance end uses in which the sheet will be heat formed or bent into soft radius shapes. It is a premium, high optic grade, polycarbonate sheet, coated with SciCron’s Mar-Con 551 advanced technology crosslinked coating. This coating has excellent resistance to a wide variety of chemicals and solvents and is considerably more abrasion resistant than the polycarbonate plastic substrate. This combination of properties provides enhanced resistance to hazing, abrasion, and marring of the sheet surfaces from cleaning, handling, and defacement efforts. Mar-Con® 551 Polycarbonate - FG also exhibits excellent impact resistance and flame spread properties. This product can be used in many more applications than would be practical for an uncoated polycarbonate sheet. Mar-Con 551 can also be applied to thin gage materials without suffering from distortions caused by typical thermal curing coating processes.",
