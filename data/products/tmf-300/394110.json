    "description": "Mar-Con® 551 Acrylic (Forming Grade) is an abrasion resistant plastic sheet product designed for a variety of high performance end uses in which the sheet will be heat formed or bent into soft radius shapes. It is a premium quality acrylic sheet, coated with Scicron’s Mar-Con 551 advanced technology cross-linked coating. This coating has excellent resistance to a wide variety of chemicals and solvents and is more abrasion resistant than the acrylic plastic substrate. This combination of properties provides enhanced resistance to hazing, marring, and abrasion, of the sheet surfaces from cleaning, handling, and defacement efforts. Mar-Con® 551 Acrylic - Forming Grade also exhibits excellent optical properties and fabrication characteristics. This product can be used in many more applications than would be practical for an uncoated acrylic sheet.",
