    "description": "TMF-300™ Check Film is a clear film product designed to control static electricity. It is a high tensile, high tear strength polyester film surfaced with Scicron Technologies proprietary, clear, C-300™ static dissipative coating. This unique technology prevents charge generation on the film surface, thereby controlling particulate attraction and preventing electrostatic discharge (ESD) events. This performance is permanent and totally independent of humidity. The film also exhibits excellent clarity, toughness, chemical resistance, surface hardness, mar resistance, and dimensional stability.",
