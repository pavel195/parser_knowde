    "description": "NovaClear® Polyimide High temperature colorless polyimide with low yellowness index \nNovaClear® Polyimide is a transparent, colorless polyimide with temperature durability comparable to many traditional amber polyimides. NovaClear® has a low yellowness index and high Tg which make this material suitable for use in display applications with high temperatures. NovaClear® is available as a film, liquid resin, or raw polymer powder. Liquid NovaClear® resin can be direct coated onto many substrates; however, unlike traditional polyimide resins, no high temperature cure is required for this material. NovaClear® can be custom formulated with pigments, dyes and many other additive chemistries to meet the needs of many applications. Contact NeXolve today to learn how NovaClear® can work for you.",
