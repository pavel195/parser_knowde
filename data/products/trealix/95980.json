    "description": "Verochic® is a green-derivative active ingredient with high deodorizing properties. Indeed, it counteracts effectively the activity of the lipase enzyme, reducing the production of fat acids that cause bad odors. It also has high exfoliating efficacy, maintaining at the same time an excellent skin hydration and avoiding irritating side effects. It is therefore indicated to be used in formulations addressed to sensitive and/or pathological skins.",
