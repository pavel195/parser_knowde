    "description": "Tripoxy™ is a two-component (1:1 mix ratio), high-solids, solvent-borne, polyamide cure, high-gloss epoxy enamel with USDA approval for incidental food contact. The cured film is extremely dense and hard, but not brittle. It is watertight and impermeable, making it suitable for submersion service. It is resistant to most common solvents, all alkalis, and most acids when splashed or spilled. The 41 series has good adhesion but only adequate wetting and penetration. Tripoxy, like all epoxies, chalks heavily when exposed to sunlight; this is noticeable after 6 months and continues for 12-18 months. Tritpoxey is also available in a clear form.",
