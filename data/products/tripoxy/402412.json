    "description": "TriBond W™ is a water-based, two-part epoxy primer that dries quickly. This primer can be quickly overcoated to meet the demands of high-speed production. TriBond W™ adheres extremely well to iron phosphate and blasted surfaces that have been properly prepared. TriBond W™ adheres well to most non-ferrous metal surfaces and can be applied over zinc galvanizing, inorganic zinc, and most other non-ferrous metal surfaces. Corrosion, water resistance, adhesion, and overall durability are all excellent.",
