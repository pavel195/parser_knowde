    "description": "Anti-Static Polyethylene is a closed-cell foam for static discharge protection. It provides critical protection to sensitive electronic parts and products. Anti-Static Polyethylene offers controlled, dissipation of electro-static charges emitted from other neighboring materials and personnel during handling, assembly, and shipment of the product. It contains internal anti-static agents designed to eliminate static-potential from the foam itself, and to dissipate electro-static discharges from other sources.",
