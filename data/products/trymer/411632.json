    "description": "Filter Foam (Reticulated Foam) is an open-pore polyurethane foam ideal for air filters in air conditioners and I.C. engines, or ceramic filters. It can also be dipped or coated to perform other functions. Reticulation is a process by which the cell walls of the foam are removed leaving a skeletal structure behind. Filter or reticulated foam works as a depth-loading filter instead of a surface-loading filter.",
