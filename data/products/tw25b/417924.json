MC1210® contains Mil-Comm’s legendary TW25B® lubricant as a core product component. It delivers outstanding performance for extreme pressure and heavy load-carrying machines or equipment. Its anti-wear and anti-corrosion properties have also qualified MC1210® for use aboard U.S. Navy warships. Our heavy duty lubricant extends the life of parts and reduces the frequency of necessary maintenance. Parts run smoother and last longer in the harshest operating conditions",
