    "description": "MODAFLOW® RESIN is an acrylic flow modifier specifically formulated without the addition of silicone. It finds application in non-aqueous industrial coatings and powder coatings, where its primary functions include enhancing flow and leveling, reducing issues like pinholes, fisheyes, craters, and orange peel. This product contributes to improved substrate wetting and helps maintain or enhance substrate adhesion. Additionally, MODAFLOW® RESIN serves as a defoaming agent, aids in air release, and facilitates pigment dispersion. It is employed in various coating applications such as top coats, powder coatings, radiation-curable coatings, clearcoats, screen printing inks, inkjet inks, varnishes, flexography inks, solventborne coatings, gravure inks, and lithographic inks. Notably, it adheres to labeling claims of being VOC-free, APEO-free, and Tin-free.",
