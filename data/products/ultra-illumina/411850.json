    "description": "Pyra-Sil™ 864 is a one-part conformal coating that cures at room temperature. When applied, it self-levels and cures in 5 minutes (or 25 seconds @150oC) and is primarily used for sealing, potting, seam-filling, and encapsulation applications. After 24 hours of curing at room temperature, it forms a flexible yet durable seal/coat capable of effective protection against weathering, moisture, UV ray damage, and high temperatures. Incure 864 can be coated on a variety of substrates, including metals and plastics, and is suitable for manual brushing as well as high volume automatic dispensing or spraying systems.",
