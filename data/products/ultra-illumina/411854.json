    "description": "Ultra-Illumina™ 3502 is a UL-compliant, 100% solids UV light curable conformal coating for PCB assembly. It is suitable for use in high-volume spray systems, does not clog valves due to the absence of volatiles, and is environmentally friendly. When fully cured, Incure 3502 forms a hard and resilient protective coating with a thickness of 30 to 150 microns that functions as a moisture barrier with excellent adhesion in harsh environments. The presence of permanent fluorescence allows for quick in-process and quality inspection of coating coverage. Moisture-curing coated components in shadowed areas take 72 hours.",
