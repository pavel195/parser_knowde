    "description": "DCL Corporation Brown 19 FDA is a yellow-brown powder produced by high temperature calcination. This pigment has good UV and visible opacity, high infrared reflection, is chemically inert, heat resistant, and stable to ultraviolet light. It is nonbleeding and non-migratory. It has low heat build-up and has exceptional durability and hiding power, and is generally used in applications where resistance to heat, light, and weather are needed. It is compatible with most resin systems and polymers, and is non-warping. Typical applications (non inclusive) are liquid and powder coatings, inks, dispersions, and other applications where equivalent pigment chemistry is used.",
