    "description": "DCL Corporation Green 30C678 is a dark green powder produced by high temperature calcination. This pigment has good UV and visible opacity, is chemically inert, heat resistant, and stable to ultraviolet light. It is non-bleeding and non-migratory. It has exceptional durability and hiding power, and is generally used in applications where resistance to heat, light, and weather are needed. It is compatible with most resin systems and polymers, and is non-warping. Typical applications (non inclusive) are liquid and powder coatings, inks, dispersions, concrete, plastics, and other applications where equivalent pigment chemistry is used.",
