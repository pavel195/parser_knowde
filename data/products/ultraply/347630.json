    "description": "FullForce™ EPDM with Secure BondTM Technology is the next generation of self adhered roof system application. Secure Bond Adhesive is factory applied which ensures uniform adhesion across the entire membrane, even through the seam, creating a powerful bond with the substrate and overlapping seam area. This advanced technology not only improves installation speed over traditional fully adhered applications, but also widens the installation window with the ability to be installed from 20 °F (-7 °C) to 120 °F (49 °C). With no VOCs emitted during field membrane application, FullForce EPDM with Secure Bond Technology is a reliable solution for all your fully adhered roofing needs.",
