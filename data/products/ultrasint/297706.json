    "description": "Farsoon Technologies FS 3300PA-F is considered for use in Powder Bed Fusion, e.g. Laser Sintering. The black powder is optimized for absorbance of Fiber Laser Light for fast melting. It shows good oxidation resistance, good dimensional stability, excellent mechanical properties especially balance of strength and toughness, and easy for processing. Suitable for products with high mechanical properties and toughness requirements, parts manufacturing or smaller parts made with adhesives, as well as complex parts and plastic models, automotive pipelines, brake tubes, stocks, grips, trigger retainers, etc.",
