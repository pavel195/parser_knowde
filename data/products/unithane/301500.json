    "description": "UNITHANE IC-470 NF is an anionic APEO free dispersion of an aliphatic polyester-based urethane in water using a co-solvent of Dipropylene dimethyl ether (CAS#11109-77-4). UNITHANE IC-470 NF is designed for industrial coating applications requiring excellent gloss, abrasion resistance, dry time, release and anti-blocking properties. UNITHANE IC-470 NF polyurethane dispersion can be used as an additive into established coatings to improve the blocking and release properties. The performance of UNITHANE IC-470 NF can be further enhanced by blending with other Union polyurethane dispersions or by the use of external crosslinking like: polyfunctional aziridines, water dispersible isocyanates or polyfunctional carbodiimides.",
