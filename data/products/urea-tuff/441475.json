    "description": "COLORCOAT AL-ESTER is a single component, liquid applied, moisturecured, aliphatic polyester-polyurethane surface protection coating. COLORCOAT AL-ESTER is a wear surface and waterproofing topcoat used in the TUFFLEX Systems. When COLORCOAT AL-ESTER is incorporated into these systems, it helps to protect concrete and plywood decks, parking structures, mechanical equipment pads and areas that require a seamless membrane system for protection against water damage. It can also be used on substrates in industrial locations, heavy vehicular and pedestrian traffic areas, and on many other properly prepared substrates. COLORCOAT AL-ESTER can also be used as a topcoat for polyurethane athletic track surfaces that need protection from oils, greases, mild chemical spillage and ultraviolet light. Do not use in areas of water immersion such as water parks and ponds.",
