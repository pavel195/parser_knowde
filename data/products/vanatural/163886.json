    "description": "VANATURAL® Bentonite Clay is a rapidly hydrating, water-washed bentonite clay. VANATURAL is a pure and natural suspension stabilizer, emulsion optimizer and rheology modifier for all topical products marketed as organic or natural. VANATURAL disperses easily into water and hydrates rapidly. VANATURAL also reduces the slippery or sticky feel of gums and polymers, while providing a silky, tack-free feel in topical preparations. This bentonite clay is synergistic with common thickeners such as VANZAN® xanthan gum and CMC. These combinations will provide greater thickening, stabilizing and suspending properties than those developed by the individual components of the mixture. VANATURAL  is OMRI-listed and authorized by ECOCERT Greenlife as complying with the ECOCERT and COSMOS standards for ecological and organic skin care products and cosmetics.",
