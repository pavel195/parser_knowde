    "description": "VANZAN® NF-C Xanthan Gum produces clear xanthan gum solutions for applications where clarity is essential. VANZAN® NF-C is widely used as a rheology control agent for aqueous systems. It increases viscosity and prevents the settling of solids in a wide variety of animal care applications. VANZAN® NF-C solutions is remarkably stable over a broad temperature range and will not change significantly between ambient temperature and 60°C. Additionally, VANZAN® NF-C has excellent freeze/thaw stability. VANZAN® NF-C is recommended for use in both acidic and alkaline systems and will retain nearly constant viscosity between pH 2 and pH 12. Mixtures of xanthan gum with water-swellable clays or certain galactomannans produce synergistic rheological effects. The mixtures will provide greater thickening, stabilizing and suspending properties than those developed by the individual components of the mixture.\r\n",
