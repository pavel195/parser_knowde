    "description": "Rose Hip Oil is obtained from the seeds of rose hips, which grow exclusively on wild rose bushes (Rosa canina L., Rosa rubiginosa and Rosa moschata) as so-called ovaries. Rose hips are harvested during dry weather when the fruit begin to ripen and take on their typical red color. The plant is native to Europe, but is cultivated in the temperate zones of America, Asia and Africa.",
