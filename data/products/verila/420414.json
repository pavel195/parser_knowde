    "description": "Verila® Li Complex EP 2 VG320 HDVT is heavy duty lubricating grease based on lithium complex thickener and high-quality mineral base oils of ISO VG320 viscosity grade. The lithium complex thickener makes the product suitable for applications within a wide temperature range, especially at elevated temperatures where conventional soap-based grease cannot be applied. The product is formulated with the high-tech additive technology which deliver to grease the right balance of performance characteristics and thus prolongs re-greasing intervals. Superior anti-wear [AW] and extreme pressure [EP] performance as well as excellent water resistance, rust and corrosion prevention and high oxidation stability extends bearing life and that means less downtime.",
