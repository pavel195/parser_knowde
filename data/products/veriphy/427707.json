    "description": "FortiPhy℠ PVD Coating is a PVD based chromium Nitride (CrN) tool coating, is a patented Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) coating technology based upon the principles of plasma acceleration. This process results in higher plasma density and an intense, low energy ion bombardment during coating deposition. Coatings formed by this process exhibit unprecedented toughness and lubricity, as well as outstanding uniformity.",
