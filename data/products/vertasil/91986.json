    "description": "Gelest Red Iron Oxide SR (RIA-SRA) is a red iron oxide powder with polycaprylylsilsesquioxane and trimethylsiloxysilicate. The hydroxyl-terminated silsesquioxane network in the coating improves adhesion to skin and hair, making it ideal for use in color cosmetic formulations. This pigment is the best candidate for use in long-wearing and water-resistant makeup.",
