    "description": "Vertec™ 1009 is a polymer filled PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) material. It exhibits good sealability, creep resistance, very low coefficient of friction and low wear rate under dry running conditions. Its non-abrasive nature makes it an ideal sealing material for use against soft metal surfaces in dynamic applications. It is suitable for water and steam service, and therefore it is a good candidate where VERTEC 1011 is not acceptable.",
