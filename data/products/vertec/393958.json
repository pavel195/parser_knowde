    "description": "Vertec™ 1028 is bronze loaded PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene). It has the best wear properties, remarkable deformation strengths and good thermal conductivity, but poor chemical resistance. It also possesses excellent creep resistance along with pure PTFE benefits like almost no moisture absorption, low friction coefficient and no flammability. It is often used in hydraulic systems. It is most suitable for piston rings, rider rings, and bearings.",
