    "description": "ETAS速 is an innovative extract obtained from asparagus, which alleviates the effects of stress by controlling the levels of cortisol. ETAS速 also shows a clinically validated efficacy for sleep improvement, support of mood and cognitive function, and protection of neuronal cells. Most of ETAS速 beneficial effects derive from its capacity to induce cytoprotective heat-shock proteins.",
