    "description": "VF Bioscience SAS Lactobacillus helveticus VFH045 has been isolated from yak milk yogurt, in the Alta√Ø mountains of Mongolia. The strain presents a remarkable proteolytic activity over a variety of protein substrates. Hydrolysis of milk casein by L. helveticus VFH045 leads to the release of peptides with a capacity to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is involved in several physiological processes, including regulation of blood pressure. L. helveticus VFH045 can be used for production of functional dairy products targeting the cardiovascular and metabolic markets.",
