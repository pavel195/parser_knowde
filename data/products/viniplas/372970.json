    "description": "Cipalite 7840 is a medium viscosity cyanoacrylate. It is suitable for bonding a wide range of materials, including porous materials, where fast curing speed is required. Cipalite 7840 is specially formulated to form strong bonds on common substrates, with good results and work performance on acidic and porous substrates, where other cyanoacrylates do not achieve good adhesion. Used to bond: wood, rubber, cork, leather, cardboard and similar surfaces. It has less dependence on surface moisture for curing speed, as is the case with most cyanoacrylates.",
