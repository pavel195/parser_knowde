    "description": "VINNAPAS® 315 is a vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymer dispersion stabilized with polyvinyl alcohol. It possesses a glass transition temperature (Tg) of +17 °C, which contributes to its exceptional heat resistance and high tensile strength. Specifically formulated as a base for high-speed packaging adhesives, VINNAPAS® 315 demonstrates remarkable wet tack and thickening responses. Its poly(vinyl alcohol) stabilization and impressive mechanical stability ensure smooth machining and enable its utilization in various roll, extruder, or spray applications.",
