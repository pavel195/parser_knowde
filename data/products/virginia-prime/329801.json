    "description": "OmegaEquis® fish oil is a highly-refined long-chain omega-3 fish oil specifically formulated as a feed ingredient or as a supplement to the horse’s daily diet. It is is flavor enhanced to encourage palatability and feed intake. Our menhaden fish oil contains 34% total omega-3 fatty acids with a balanced concentration of EPA and DHA. This highly refined fish oil is alkali refined to reduce free fatty acids, bleached to reduce color and remove oxidative precursors, and then fractioned to produce a clear, fluid liquid. The final step of refining sets OmegaEquis® fish oil apart by adding a fruity flavor horses love.",
