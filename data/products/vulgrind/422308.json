    "description": "Cuprisan is a unique waste treatable copper complex designed to neutralize odor causing sulfides and reactive cations such as Al+3 and Fe+2. Cuprisan can be added tank-side or formulated into the coolant concentrate to provide long term odor control. Cuprisan works synergistically with biocides. When used with an Isothiazolinone-based microbicide, as little as 20% of the normal dosage is required to attain a complete kill and maintain a controlled fluid. Cuprisan will immediately eliminate and prevent the recurrence of most coolant-borne odors such as the common rotten egg smell and will aid in the stabilization of water-based cutting fluids.",
