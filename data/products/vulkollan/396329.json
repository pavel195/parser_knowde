    "description": "Solid Vulkollan® 18/40 fills the gap in the hardness range between rubber-elastic materials and hard plastics (e.g. polyamide) and can be adjusted between 65 Shore hardness A and 70 Shore hardness D. Due to its excellent property profile, Vulkollan® is used in all areas of industry where the highest demands are placed on the material. Articles of different geometries from a few grams to more than 100kg unit weight can be produced economically both in large series and in individual production.",
