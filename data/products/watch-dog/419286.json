Works quickly on almost all automotive surfaces (including hoods, doors, bumpers, etc.), engine and machine parts, tools, and other smooth surfaces. For porous surfaces like concrete, pavers, asphalt, garage floors, driveways, gas stations, factories, basements, and auto shops, allow about 20 minutes for the product to penetrate the substrate before removing.",
