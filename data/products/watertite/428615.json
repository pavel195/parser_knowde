    "description": "Aquaban 100F is a two component flexible cementitious coating and reactive waterproofing for concrete or masonry surfaces, interior or exterior, above or below grade. AQUABAN 100F penetrates surface pores and interacts with free lime to create an integral mechanical and chemical bond and a dense waterproof coating. Once applied, its unique chemical action forms insoluble complex polysilicates from the soluble salts found in cementitious materials. As this integral bonding takes place within the pores of the substrate, a waterproof shield is formed which seals the inner structure of the treated surface. The dense flexible plaster like coating remaining on the surface of the substrate acts as an additional water barrier. AQUABAN 100F prevents intrusion of water, yet allows entrapped moisture to be released.",
