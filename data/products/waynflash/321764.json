    "description": "Corrosperse™ 176A-100 70% is a 70% dispersion of Strontium Chromate in Aromatic 100. It has a Fineness of Grind (7 Hegman) which means no grinding is required and it can easily be incorporated using high speed mixing techniques. Because the product is a pourable liquid, there are none of the concerns associated with Hexavalent Chrome in pigment form, specifically respirable dust exposure.",
