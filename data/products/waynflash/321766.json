    "description": "Corrosperse™ 176M is a 70% dispersion of Strontium Chromate in Methyl Amyl Ketone, It has a Fineness of Grind (7 Hegman) which means no grinding is required and it can easily be incorporated using high speed mixing techniques. Because the product is a pourable liquid, there are none of the concerns associated with Hexavalent Chrome in pigment form, specifically exposure to dust.",
