    "description": "Ply-Guard AS is a fast-curing, two-component polyaspartic (aliphatic polyurea) coating system. Ply-Guard AS exhibits superior color and gloss retention, excellent abrasion resistance, good flexibility, and can be applied directly to properly prepared concrete or metal surfaces. In addition, Ply-Guard AS has very good corrosion, chemical, and UV resistance, and can achieve a uniform coating thickness of 2-8 mils DFT per coat that is free of bubbles and pinholes.",
