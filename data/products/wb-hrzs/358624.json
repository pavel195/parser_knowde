    "description": "Ply-Guard TC is a two component, high solids aliphatic polyurethane. This product offers a remarkable combination of performance properties not found in other polymer coatings. Ply-Guard TC produces protective films which are hard, flexible and very impact resistant. These coatings feature high abrasion and scratch resistance, exterior durability, easy soil release, and excellent resistance to a broad range of chemicals. For exterior applications, a UV stabilizer package is incorporated to insure long term chalk resistance and gloss retention. A special accelerator is available when rapid project turnaround is required.",
