    "description": "This all-natural, Lemon White Barrel Aged Balsamic Condimento is made for us by one of the most renowned makers of Balsamic Vinegars in Italy. It is made in Modena, Italy using traditional methods. First quality grape must, which is obtained from whole pressed grapes from locally grown late-harvested varietals, particularly Trebbiano and Lambrusco, is reduced by roughly half and left to ferment naturally for up to three weeks. The resulting concentrated grape must is then blended with a small amount of premium aged white wine vinegar to balance the acidity and matured and further concentrated for a minimum of 18 months in Slavonia Oak casks.Natural Lemon flavoring is then added to the resulting White Balsamic Condimento and a clear colored balsamic is made which is popular for dishes where the dark color of a red balsamic is not desired. It has a velvety texture and a slight fruity sweetness, balanced 4.5% acidity and mellow oak undertones.Our Sicilian Lemon White Barrel Aged Balsamic Condimento should not be used as an ingredient when cooking, as heat might affect the balance of sweet and sour and cause bitterness. It can and should, however, be used after cooking. It is perfect for finishing stews, risottos, scallops, grilled meats and fish. It is, of course, also extraordinary over fresh cut berries, melon, aged cheeses and vanilla ice cream.Product of Italy.Contains Naturally Occurring Sulfites.",
