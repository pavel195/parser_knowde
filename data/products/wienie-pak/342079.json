    "description": "Nova XT is a stable, stronger oriented plastic casing designed for cylindrical products. It’s ideal for high-expansion products that need to cope with high tension. This casing has a five-layer construction for the desired shelf life and extremely low weight loss during processing and storage. It’s recommended for products that are hanged during processing and require good final-size consistency. The application formulation determines exactly which Nova to use in order to achieve yield and stuff to finished sizing specifications.",
