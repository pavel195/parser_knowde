    "description": "Rosamox™ is a low color, low odor natural antioxidant from Kemins proprietary line of non-GMO rosemary (INCI: Rosmarinus officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract), grown through a vertically integrated sustainable process and extracted using Supercritical CO2 extraction. The rosemary plants Kemin has selected to create Rosamox™ is based on the highest possible levels of targeted molecules with antioxidant activity that all work together to provide optimal skin and formula benefits. Rosamox™ protects skin against the two main culprits of oxidative stresses that dramatically speed up the skin aging process as a result of photo-aging and glycation by effectively quenching free radicals induced by the sun exposure and the sugar consumption. Rosamox™ enhances skin appearance leaving it soothed, smooth and well-conditioned, and helps bring back healthy looking skin from outside-in and inside-out! As a second benefit, Rosamox™ overcomes oxidation and rancidity challenges with comparable or better efficacy in comparison with synthetic BHT and tocopherol acetate showing significant protection of the most commonly used highly unstable oils in personal care products, making it as an efficacious natural antioxidant alternative. Rosamox™ has applications in all type of products and is made from SCS Sustainability Grown rosemary and is ECOCERT® and COSMOS® approved.",
