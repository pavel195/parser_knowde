    "description": "ACULYN(TM) 38 Polymer is an alkali-swellable anionic acrylic polymer emulsion (ASE) that is lightly crosslinked to impart a short pseudoplastic flow. It is a liquid, cold-processable product that instantaneously thickens upon neutralization, providing ease of handling and increased manufacturing efficiency. This thickener is offered at 28% solids and has been developed for use as a rheology modifier and suspending agent for personal care surfactant formulations. It is effective in a range of personal care surfactants and is useful at a pH range of 3 - 11, depending on the formulation. It is stable in the presence of sodium chloride and two common conditioning agents, polyquaternium-7 and polyquaternium-10, as well as polar solvents and zinc pyrithione. The polymer has a well-established toxicological profile and is safe in normal use.",
