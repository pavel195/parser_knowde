    "description": "XL2000™ is designed as a unique internal and external ceramic coating system for the most intense heat shielding barrier, withstanding temperatures up to 2000°F. XL2000™ extreme temperature coating is engineered especially for turbos, high performance diesel and racing applications and is designed to be applied primarily to exhaust components. Its properties will remain color stable and stain resistant at exhaust gas temperatures up to 2000°F. Due to its unique ceramic nature, the coating also functions as a very effective thermal barrier, with reduced thermal radiation characteristics. The coating cures to a very hard, durable surface with excellent adhesion.\r\n",
