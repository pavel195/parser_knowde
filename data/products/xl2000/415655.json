    "description": "KECO 500 is a resin-bonded lubricant coating designed for dry film lubrication for a variety of industrial, commercial, and military applications. It gives lubrication for components which are inaccessible after assembly and must function reliably with no maintenance. It is also excellent against chemical and corrosion resistance. KECO 500 also has an extremely long wear life. Offering solid film lubrication, it meets requirements for chemical resistance, anti-galling, and wear resistance of military specifications. Providing lifetime lubrication for components that are inaccessible after assembly, it functions reliably even after long periods with no maintenance. Effective performance is achieved even with thin films, 0.0003 inches (8 microns) thick, so there is little interference with operating tolerances. KECO 500 provides excellent salt spray resistance.",
