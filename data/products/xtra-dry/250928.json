    "description": "Bin-Aid Anti-Bridging Agent is a unique anti-bridging agent for pelleted feeds, especially those containing urea and or high molasses levels. When associated with steam, water or friction heat, Bin-Aidforms an aqueous suspension that coats and lubricates the feed particles. Once the pellets pass through the pellet cooler, the lubricant film dries, reducing pellet bridging in the holding bin.",
