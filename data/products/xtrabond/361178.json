    "description": "XtraBond® HT is a one part, easy to use, non-slumping paste that cures to a silicone rubber when exposed to atmospheric moisture at room temperature. This product is engineered to provide a durable, watertight bond when exposed to continuous temperatures ranging from -40° to 500°F on a continuous basis – while maintaining its integrity at up to 600°F for intermittent time periods. Its unique formulation acts as both a thermal and electrical insulator as well, so it is ideal for sealing around heating elements.",
