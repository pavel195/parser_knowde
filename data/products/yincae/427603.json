    "description": "Yincae® SMT 138E is a family of microchip assembly and ball attachment adhesive products that are used to enhance solder joint reliability and eliminate solder joint cracking in CSP, BGA, flip chips and POP microchip applications. They remove metal oxide and allow individual solder joints to be formed, encapsulated by a 3-D polymer network. The resulting solder joint bond is 5 to 10 times stronger than that of conventional underfill. These products are specially engineered for use in lead-free, Sn/Pb and Sn/Bi processes.",
