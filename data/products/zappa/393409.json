    "description": "GR Hersbrucker is a delicate stunner from the Hallertau region of southern Germany, this noble variety with moderate yields is often grown in place of the famous Hallertauer Mittelfr√ºh thanks to increased disease resistance. Spicy, floral notes reign, while hay, tobacco, and citrus may also shine through.",
