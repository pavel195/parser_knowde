    "description": "ZAROX OYN 14 Fluid was developed for use in applications where a wide operating temperature range, low friction, non-flammability, and compatibility with other materials is required. The product is also classified as non-toxic and is biologically inert. A similar product ZAROX OYC 14 SUV is also available with a UV detectable additive to allow detectability and process control following application if required. Because ZAROX OYN 14 fluid is essentially inert it is safe to use with all metals, plastics, leather, elastomers and seal materials and is totally non-flammable.",
