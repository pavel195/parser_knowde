The range is designed to enable continuous operation at high temperature, with minimized friction and good thermal / oxidative stability properties. PROGILINE® Gear PG lubricants allow thermally stable operation at temperatures exceeding 200°C, and offer anticipated service lifetimes of all grades in excess of 10,000 hours at 100°C, enabling extended service intervals and in some instances a fill-for-life lubricant.",
