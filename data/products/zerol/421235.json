    "description": "PROGILINE® FI 50100 Foam Inhibitor is a 100% active polyalkylene glycol foam inhibitor. The product is designed specifically for the defoaming and suppression of foam in sugar beet processing applications. Progiline FI 50100 is effective in various stages of the process, including diffusion, liming and carbonation. PROGILINE® FI 50100 may be dosed directly into the system, typically at concentrations of 5-20 ppm, but alternatively may be formulated with other components such as fatty acids or water to create lower cost formulations of lower viscosity, which enables easier dosing into systems. Formulations with water and fatty acid typically require only simple agitation prior to use. Progiline FI 50100 is extremely efficiently dispersed and is suitable for application in a wide range of diffusion systems.",
