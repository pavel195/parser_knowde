    "description": "SYNTRAN® 5288 is based on a patented olefin grafted technology. An amorphous functional acrylic polymer section is grafted onto a crystalline polyethylene backbone. The crystalline portion provides barrier, moisture retention, elasticity, and tactile attributes such as lubricity and \"feel\". The amorphous portion provides film formation, adhesion, substantivity, and formulation flexibility.\n\nThe grafting technology results in a uniform film with the benefits of both chemistries. Its recommended use level is 5 to 55 percent as supplied.",
