The nano-filled material provides a chemical inertness only seen in much more costly FFKM grades and been developed for plasma ash or resist strip, chlorine and CxFy based etch processes.\n\nNanofluorÂ® grades provide some of the lowest trace metal contamination levels available from elastomer seals and ultra-low permeation rates.",

Compatible with fluorine based chemistries and universally suitable for both wet and dry semiconductor processes including Lithography, Plasma, PVD, CVD, Etch, Stripping and Cleaning.PerlastÂ® G74P combines a fully fluorinated polymer backbone, a fully fluorinated nano-filler system (no inorganic fillers) and a highly fluorinated cross-linking process, which results in a perfluoroelastomer with unrivaled purity, chemical resistance and mechanical properties.PerlastÂ® G74P exhibits extremely low out-gassing properties, making it ideal for use in vacuum applications.Key Attributes Exceptionally pure - does not contain any inorganic fillers which may cause particulation problems. Excellent chemical and temperature resistance. Excellent mechanical properties. Extremely low out-gassing properties making it ideal for vacuum sealing applications. High material compliance reduces surface permeation. Reduced first wafer effect. Lower cost of ownership. Typical Applications Dynamic seals Static seals Wafer-handling products",

Compatible with fluorine based chemistries and universally suitable for both wet and dry semiconductor processes including Lithography, Plasma, PVD, CVD, Etch, Stripping and Cleaning.PerlastÂ® G67P combines a fully fluorinated polymer backbone, a fully fluorinated nano-filler system (no inorganic fillers) and a highly fluorinated cross-linking process, which results in a perfluoroelastomer with unrivaled purity and chemical resistance.PerlastÂ® G67P has a significantly lower compressive modulus than traditional perfluoroelastomers, making it highly compliant. So for a given compression, it exhibits a low reaction force, this results in lower stress on the seal, which leads to longer life expectancy.Key Attributes Exceptionally pure - does not contain any inorganic fillers which may cause particulation problems. Excellent chemical and temperature resistance. Excellent mechanical properties. Extremely low out-gassing properties making it ideal for vacuum sealing applications. High sealing efficiency. High material compliance reduces surface permeation. Reduced first wafer effect. Lower cost of ownership. Typical Applications Dynamic seals Static seals Wafer-handling products",

In addition, this perfluoroelastomer has low permeability and as a result, it is less prone to swelling, leading to extended in- service performance in, for example, valves, pumps and mechanical seals.PerlastÂ® G75TX is suitable for both dynamic and static applications and can be fully molded into O-rings (any size up to 2.5m/8ft external diameter) and custom shapes.Key Attributes Very high temperature resistance Ultra low compression set Excellent chemical resistance to a broad range of chemicals Exceptional acid and amine resistance Superior mechanical properties Long-term sealing efficiency at high temperatures Extremely low out-gassing properties Good steam resistance (ASME BPE 2000) Typical Applications Aerospace Chemical Processing Diesel Semiconductor Oil &amp; Gas",

In addition, this perfluoroelastomer has low permeability and as a result, it is less prone to swelling, leading to extended in-service performance in, for example, valves, pumps and mechanical seals.A high modulus makes PerlastÂ® G75B resistant to extrusion and ideal for use in medium-high pressure applications. In addition, the low cumulative compression set provides a high mean-time between maintenance cycles in hot chemically aggressive environments.PerlastÂ® G75B is suitable for both dynamic and static applications and can be fully molded into O-rings (any size up to 2m/6.5ft internal diameter) and custom shapes.Key Attributes Excellent chemical resistance to a wide range of chemicals Exceptional acid and amine resistance Superior mechanical properties Long-term sealing efficiency at high temperature Extremely low out-gassing properties Good steam resistance (ASME BPE 2000) Less than 2% swell in MIL-L-23699C jet oil after 336 hours at 200Â°C Typical Applications Aerospace Chemical Processing Diesel Semiconductor Oil &amp; Gas",

Developed for use in advanced wet and dry semiconductor processes down to the 45nm node and beyond, this material has ultra-low out-gassing properties, high temperature stability and excellent plasma resistance to provide effective sealing in extreme conditions.PerlastÂ® G100XT combines a fully fluorinated polymer backbone with a highly fluorinated cross-linking system to provide a material with exceptional resistance to high temperature and aggressive semiconductor processes. The fully organic structure of the material helps to eliminate particles and reduce cost of ownership. The superior chemical performance of the material is enhanced by exceptionally low compression set, high elongation and ultimate tensile strength.PerlastÂ® G100XT has a low modulus, giving it a very high sealing efficiency. The material is highly resistant to stress induced chemical attack in constant compression or constant strain environments, leading to longer service life and reliable sealing performance.Key Attributes Exceptionally pure - does not contain any inorganic fillers which may cause particulation problems. High temperature stability Exceptionally low compression set Excellent mechanical properties Ultra low out-gassing High sealing efficiency Reduced Cost of Ownership (CoO) Typical Applications Static Seals Wafer Handling Products",

This perflouroelastomer material has been specifically developed to perform under extreme conditions, in temperatures as low as -46Â°C (-51Â°F).PerlastÂ® ICE G75LT has been formulated to provide increased resistance to a broad range of chemicals by carefully controlling the molecular architecture. In addition, this perfluoroelastomer has low permeability and as a result, it is less prone to swelling, leading to extended in-service performance in valves, pumps and mechanical seals.Ideal for use in exploration and completion applications and equipment operating or stored in sub-zero conditions. PerlastÂ® ICE G75LT is suitable for both dynamic and static applications and can be fully molded into O-rings (any size up to 2.5m/8ft internal diameter) and custom shapes.Key Attributes Excellent low-temperature sealing capability Good high temperature resistance Low compression set Excellent chemical resistance to a broad range of chemicals Exceptional acid and amine resistance Good mechanical properties Typical Applications Aerospace - static O-rings Chemical processing - pumps &amp; valves Mechanical seals Downstream refinery &amp; petrochem equipment Cryogenic equipment Gas storage &amp; transportation Oil &amp; Gas - subsea equipment Completion tools Drilling tools (deepwater) Pipe connectors Pumps, valves &amp; compressors",
