    "description": "Cogent is the market leading adjuvant for use with translocated grass-weed herbicides (e.g. fop/dim/den and SU). The unique combination of surfactants ensures that the herbicide is coated evenly over the target surface, with up to 45% better coverage than standard oil-based adjuvants. Active penetrant ethoxylated adjuvants increase herbicide uptake by up to 50% in comparison with methylated seed oils (MSOs) ensuring more rapid uptake of active ingredient through target wax layer and No increased crop phytotoxicity.",
