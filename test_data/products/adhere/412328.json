    "description": "Prosper ST contains potassium phosphite combined with a range of nutrients in a readily compatible seed treatment formulation. When applied to seed, it increases the level of the cytokinin cis-Zeatin that boosts both primary and lateral root growth. A typical response is a 30% increase in root biomass. New research has also demonstrated an increase in nitrate reductase activity resulting in increased nitrogen assimilation and shoot growth.",
