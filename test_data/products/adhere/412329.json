    "description": "Inferno improves the deposition and retention of spray droplets, and is an effective pH buffer, water conditioner and anti-foam. Inferno significantly reduces the number of spray droplets under 100 microns, reducing spray drift by up to 75%. Additional studies demonstrated less glyphosate drift at 70cm with Inferno compared with glyphosate alone at 50cm (Source: Silsoe trials 2019), improving product performance and environmental profile. Inferno softens hard water by effective and rapid sequestration of Ca2+ and Mg2+. These hard water cations are bound and rendered unavailable in a soluble form.",
