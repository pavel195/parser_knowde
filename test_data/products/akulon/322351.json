    "description": "Stanyl® TW213F2 is a high-performance polyamide that provides unmatched performance and value for demanding applications in which superior heat resistance, design stiffness, wear and friction, and process flow qualities are required. This high-performance polyamide 46 is used for applications in automotive, E&amp;E, gears, and outdoor power equipment. Since it retains its mechanical properties at high temperatures up to 220 °C, this makes it ideal for extremely high-performance applications, where it outperforms PPA, PA6T, PA9T, and often PPS and LCP. A suitable processing technology for the product is injection molding. Special features include heat stabilization.",
