    "description": "CastSeal™ is a uniquely formulated, 2 part, VOC free Brush-On-Sealant™. The very low viscosity ( 3-5 mPa-s 8-10 cps at 25° C) provides excellent wetting, and enables CastSeal™ to wick (through capillary action) into pores, welds, and seams and between close-fitting metal surfaces. Mixing the sealant’s two components creates a VOC-free liquid that can be easily applied by brush.",
