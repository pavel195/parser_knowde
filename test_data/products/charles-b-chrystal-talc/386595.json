    "description": "Talc MP 44-26 is designed for use in interior and exterior architectural coatings as well as industrial primers and topcoats. Talcâ€™s chemically inert nature improves the weatherability of coatings containing talc. The hydrophobic nature of talc contributes to the rheological properties (anti-sag, leveling, and brushability) and gloss of the coating as well as providing sheen control. In addition, the softness of talc reduces wear on processing equipment.",
