    "description": "Duocel® Copper Foam is a rigid, three-dimensional network of interconnected copper ligaments that form cells with open pores. Duocel® Copper Foam contains completely solid ligaments (as opposed to sintered or hollow ligaments) which makes it stronger and more thermally conductive. Its properties are fully customizable, which allows its performance characteristics to be optimized for a broad range of applications. It is commonly used in applications that benefit from very high thermal conductivity and surface area, and from the nature-mimicking morphology of the rigid cellular structure.\r\n",
