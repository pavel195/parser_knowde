    "description": "EVERNOX-76 is a sterically hindered phenolic antioxidant with a highly effective, non-discoloring, odorless, good compatibility with most substrates and high resistance to extraction. EVERNOX-76 can be applied in polyolefins, such as PE, PP and well as in other polymers such as styrenics and styrene homo and copolymers such as IPS, ABS, MBS and engineering plastics such as PBT, PET and PUR, elastomers like SBS, SBR, BR, adhesives and other organic substrates. EVERNOX-76 can be combined with other additives such as costabilizer (e.g. thioesters, phosphites, phosphonites), light stabilizer and other functional stabilizers. The synergistic blends of EVERNOX-76 with EVERFOS-168 are extreme performance in polymers stabilization.",
