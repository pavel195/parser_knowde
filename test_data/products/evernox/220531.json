    "description": "EVERNOX-B210 is used in polyolefins and olefins-copolymers such as LDPE, HDPE, LLDPE, PP and EVA. It can also be used in other polymers such as engineering plastics, styrene homo and copolymers such as PBT, PET, PA, POM, PS, ABS, PUR, elastomers BR, SBR, SBS, adhesives and other organic substrates. The B-blends can be used in combination with light stabilizers of UV-absorbers and hindered amine light stabilizers.",
