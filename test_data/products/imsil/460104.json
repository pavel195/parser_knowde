    "description": "AFCONA 7525 is a block polymer with acidic functionality and viscosity-depressing properties. It is recommended for use in unsaturated polyester, PVC, epoxy, and polyurethane resin systems and is primarily used as a wetting and dispersing agent in highly filled systems, providing strong viscosity-depressing properties. It has excellent wetting and dispersing properties with pigments and functional fillers such as ATH, resulting in very low viscosity.",
