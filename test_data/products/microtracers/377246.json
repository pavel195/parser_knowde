    "description": "Microtracers™ FS are stainless steel particles colored with FD&amp;C water soluble dyes or the water insoluble “lake” form of such dyes. Microtracers FS are used primarily to code drugs so they can be quantified in premixes and final feeds. Microtracers FS are magnetically retrievable from feeds via a Mason Jar Test (qualitative), Rotary Detector (qualitative or quantitative), or a magnetic probe (quantitative). They are formulated in animal health feed products such as coccidiostats and therapeutic animal drugs.",
