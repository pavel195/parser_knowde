    "description": "Microtracers™ -RF are iron powder colored with water soluble FD&amp;C colors, designed to be used in feeds or premixes. Microtracers-RF may be assayed qualitatively using a Rotary Detector or the Mason Jar Technique in less than one minute in premixes and mash feds and in two minutes in pellets ground to mash. For qualitative tests, the tracer will yield a ring of color on a filter paper, indicating the presence or absence of the product it is coding. Microtracers-RF can also be determined quantitatively by eluting the dye from the tracer, reading its absorbance at a specific wavelength, and comparing it to a set of standard curves.",
