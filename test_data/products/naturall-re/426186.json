    "description": "Naturall-e™ d-Alpha Tocopheryl Succinate 1210IU Non-GMO Sunflower is off-white to white color powder with little or no odor &amp; taste. It is derived from 100% Non-GMO Sunflower oilseed source. It is esterified form of d-alpha-tocopherol in which the succinate group protects the hydroxyl group of the chromanol ring from oxidation. Hence it is a more stable form than d-alphatocopherol, the free or non-esterified form. It is intended to be used as Natural Vitamin E supplement in food &amp; nutraceutical industry. It is suitable for use in organic food and nutritional supplements.",
