    "description": "Novaguard EHGP is a mild broad spectrum liquid blend for the preservation of personal care products. It is a blend of Phenoxyethanol and Ethyl hexylglycerine. It is a paraben free alternative to traditional preservatives. It is an alternative to Euxyl PE9010 and Lexguard PE9010. Novaguard EHGP is a cosmetic preservative based on Phenoxylethanol and Ethylhexylglycerine. It has a broad, balanced spectrum of effect against bacteria, yeasts and mold fungi. The addition of Ethylhexyl- glycerine affects the interfacial tension at the cell membrane of microorganisms, improving the preservative activity of phenoxyethanol. Using Novaguard EHGP is particularly suitable for emulsions, oil and surfactant based formulations and may be used in aqueous formulations up to its solubility limit of approximately 1.0 %. Novaguard EHGP can be added to the formulation at temperatures up to 80Â°C, prolonged heating at elevated temperatures is not recommended. No discolourations have been detected.",
