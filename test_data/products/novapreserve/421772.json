    "description": "Ethyl Paraben provides the good performance against Gram positive bacteria exhibited by all the parabens and has the same limitations regarding pH range (acidic only), system compatibility (avoid high levels of ethoxylates) and water solubility (limited). Ethyl paraben has been used in combination with Propylparaben in oral preparations for controlling fennentative action. It can be used alone but is generally used at 0.10 to 0.25% levels with other Parabens as the antifungal portion of the preservative system. Ethyl Paraben is an ethyl ester resulting from the formal condensation of the carboxy group of 4-hydroxyben- zoic acid with ethanol ; It has a role as an antimicrobial food preservative, an antifungal agent. Ethyl Paraben is mainly used as antiseptics in cosmetics, food and medicine. It also can be used as feed preservatives and antiseptiC for bacteria. It is non- irritant, low toxic level and effective at low concentration.",
