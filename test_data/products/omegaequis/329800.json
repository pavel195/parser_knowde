    "description": "Virginia Prime® Gold Fish Oil is a refined long-chain omega-3 fish oil specifically formulated as a palatable feed ingredient. Omega Protein’s fish oil contains approximately 35% total omega-3 fatty acids with a balanced concentration of EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid) and DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid). Our refined oils have been fractionated and filtered to improve viscosity and handling characteristics. Virginia Prime® Gold is also alkali refined to reduce free fatty acids and bleached to reduce color and odor.",
