    "description": "OTech Fabric silver particle-free conductive ink is optimized for printing on various textiles. The ink stays on the surface and does not penetrate the textile. Perfect for application in wearables and innovations with e-textiles. OrelTech’s unique process allows the deposition of highly conductive thin metallic films. The thin layers undergo short development using cold plasma treatment resulting in a fine metal structure. OrelTech’s technology enables the deposition of the ink with many different methods and on various substrates, from plastics to fabrics. OTech inks do not contain nanoparticles, and as such enable the material economy of precious metals while being significantly more environmentally friendly than the existing alternatives on the market.",
