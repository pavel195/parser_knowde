    "description": "Synthetic esters emulsified in water. P-80® THIX Temporary Assembly Lubricant Gel is a biodegradable assembly aid that eases installation of tight-fitting rubber and plastic parts by reducing the force needed for insertion. Once assembly is complete, the lubricant dries, resulting in a secure assembly. P-80® THIX is especially useful in overhead and vertical assembly operations because it remains where it is applied without dripping.",
