    "description": "Description Perlast® G75TX is the ultimate ‘next generation' perfluoroelastomer, offering a combination of excellent chemical resistance and ultra-high temperature stability, simultaneously extending the operating limits in all aspects.Perlast® G75TX has been formulated to provide increased resistance to a broad range of chemicals by carefully controlling the molecular architecture. In addition, this perfluoroelastomer has low permeability and as a result, it is less prone to swelling, leading to extended in- service performance in, for example, valves, pumps and mechanical seals.Perlast® G75TX is suitable for both dynamic and static applications and can be fully molded into O-rings (any size up to 2.5m/8ft external diameter) and custom shapes.Key Attributes Very high temperature resistance Ultra low compression set Excellent chemical resistance to a broad range of chemicals Exceptional acid and amine resistance Superior mechanical properties Long-term sealing efficiency at high temperatures Extremely low out-gassing properties Good steam resistance (ASME BPE 2000) Typical Applications Aerospace Chemical Processing Diesel Semiconductor Oil &amp; Gas",
