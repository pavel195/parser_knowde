    "description": "Pioneer Solutions Americas Solid Acrylic Resin BM61A is a copolymer of methacrylates. It offers performance on excellent adhesion, good flexibility, low shrinkage and good durability. BM 61A is a kind of alcohol solubility resin. It can be dissolved in many organic solvents such as alcohol, ketones, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated solvents. It has good compatibility with NC, chlorinated rubber, vinyl resin, cellulose acetate and also plasticizer. BM61A is commonly used in UV ink formulation as inert resin to enhance adhesion and to reduce shrinkage. It is also widely used in aluminum heat sealing lacquer, cardboard ink, and metal coatings.",
