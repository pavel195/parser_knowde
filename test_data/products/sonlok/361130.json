    "description": "SONLOK® 3660 is a fast curing; paste like consistency, high strength anaerobic retaining compound for cylindrical fitting parts particularly where bond gaps can approach 0.50mm. This product offers very good gap cure properties. SONLOK® 3660 retaining compound is a single component anaerobic adhesive, which develops high strength rapidly when confined in the absence of air between close fitting metal surfaces to prevent loosening and leakage from shock and vibration.",
