    "description": "SYNPRINT AC 4110 is a water-based, cationic acrylic copolymer solution. SYNPRINT AC 4110 is recommended for primers with excellent adhesion on critical substrates such as metallised foil. Moreover, films formulated with SYNPRINT AC 4110 form a receptive layer for water-based anionic inks. The low minimum film-forming temperature allows the formulation of low-VOC formulations.\r\n\r\nFeatures and Benefits:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tExcellent adhesion to a wide variety of substrates\r\n\tExcellent bonding of anionic inks Low MFFT\r\n\tExcellent, universal stain-blocking properties\r\n\tFree of APEO and co-solvents\r\n\r\n",
