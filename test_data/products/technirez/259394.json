    "description": "TECHNIREZ® RME-912 is a solid adduct of a “4” type solid diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A epoxy resin and a carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile elastomer. RME-912 is epoxy functional and therefore compatible with all epoxy resins. The product offers low temperature melting and high elastomer content. RME-912 is easily dissolved in a variety of solvents such as MEK, toluene and xylene. Due to its high elastomeric content, significant improvements in impact resistance, thermal shock resistance and fatigue resistance may be seen when used alone or in combination with other epoxy resins. The product is offered as a coarse pellet or as a fine ground (180 micron) powder or as superfine 74 micron grade.",
